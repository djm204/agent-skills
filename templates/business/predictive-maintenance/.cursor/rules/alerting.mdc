# Alert Management

Guidelines for configuring, routing, and managing predictive maintenance alerts.

## Alert Severity Levels

| Level | Condition | Response Time | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| P1 - Critical | Imminent failure (RUL < 48h) or safety risk | < 1 hour | Stop asset, emergency maintenance |
| P2 - High | Significant degradation (RUL < 2 weeks) | < 8 hours | Schedule urgent maintenance |
| P3 - Medium | Moderate degradation detected | < 48 hours | Plan maintenance in next window |
| P4 - Low | Early degradation signal, trend emerging | Next review cycle | Monitor, add to watchlist |
| P5 - Info | Anomaly detected, no confirmed degradation | Log only | Record for pattern analysis |

## Alert Routing

| Severity | Primary Recipient | Secondary | Channel |
|----------|------------------|-----------|---------|
| P1 | On-shift operator + maintenance lead | Plant manager | SMS + phone + dashboard |
| P2 | Maintenance planner | Shift supervisor | Email + dashboard + mobile push |
| P3 | Maintenance planner | Asset engineer | Dashboard + email |
| P4 | Asset engineer | Analytics team | Dashboard |
| P5 | Analytics team | - | Log only |

## Threshold Configuration

### Static Thresholds

Set absolute limits based on manufacturer specs or engineering standards:

```text
Example: Bearing vibration
- Normal: < 4.5 mm/s
- Warning (P4): 4.5 - 7.1 mm/s
- Alert (P3): 7.1 - 11.2 mm/s
- Danger (P2): 11.2 - 18.0 mm/s
- Critical (P1): > 18.0 mm/s
```

### Dynamic Thresholds

Adapt limits based on operating context:

- Adjust for load level (higher vibration is normal at higher load)
- Adjust for ambient temperature
- Use rolling baseline: alert when reading > mean + N standard deviations

### Model-Based Alerts

Triggered by prediction models rather than raw sensor values:

- RUL estimate drops below threshold
- Anomaly score exceeds confidence threshold
- Degradation rate accelerates beyond historical norm

## Alert Quality Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| True positive rate | Confirmed issues / Total alerts | > 80% |
| False alarm rate | Non-issues / Total alerts | < 15% |
| Missed detection rate | Undetected failures / Total failures | < 5% |
| Alert-to-action time | Time from alert to maintenance decision | < SLA per severity |

## Alert Fatigue Prevention

- **Suppress duplicates**: Same asset, same condition, within suppression window
- **Aggregate related alerts**: Multiple sensors on one asset = one alert with details
- **Escalate, don't repeat**: If P4 is not acknowledged in 48h, escalate to P3
- **Tune continuously**: Review false alarms monthly, adjust thresholds quarterly
- **Snooze with accountability**: Allow temporary suppression with documented reason and expiration

## Common Pitfalls

### Too Many P1 Alerts

Wrong: Set tight thresholds to "catch everything." Result: 50 P1 alerts per day, all ignored.

Right: Reserve P1 for genuine imminent failure or safety risk. Use P3-P4 for early warnings.

### Static Thresholds on Variable Assets

Wrong: Same vibration threshold for an asset running at 50% load and 100% load.

Right: Normalize thresholds against operating conditions. Use dynamic or model-based approaches.
