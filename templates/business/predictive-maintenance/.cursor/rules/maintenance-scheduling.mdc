# Maintenance Scheduling

Guidelines for optimizing maintenance timing, balancing asset health against operational constraints.

## Maintenance Strategy Spectrum

```text
Reactive         Time-Based          Condition-Based       Predictive
(Fix on fail)    (Calendar/Hours)    (Threshold triggers)  (Model-driven RUL)
   ←── Increasing maturity and cost-effectiveness ──→
```

## Strategy Selection by Asset Criticality

| Criticality | Strategy | Rationale |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| Safety-critical | Predictive + time-based floor | Cannot risk failure; dual approach |
| Production-critical | Predictive primary | Maximize uptime, minimize unplanned stops |
| Standard | Condition-based | Act when degradation detected |
| Non-critical | Reactive | Run to failure; replacement cost < monitoring cost |

## Scheduling Decision Tree

```text
Model predicts degradation?
├── Yes → RUL > next planned shutdown?
│   ├── Yes → Schedule for next planned shutdown
│   └── No → RUL > minimum lead time for parts/labor?
│       ├── Yes → Schedule dedicated maintenance window
│       └── No → Emergency maintenance; escalate
└── No → Continue monitoring at current frequency
```

## Maintenance Window Optimization

Factors to balance when scheduling:

- **Asset RUL estimate** with confidence interval
- **Production schedule** (minimize impact on output)
- **Parts availability** (lead time for critical spares)
- **Labor availability** (skilled technician scheduling)
- **Co-location opportunities** (batch nearby assets in same window)
- **Weather and access constraints** (outdoor or remote assets)

## Spare Parts Management

| Part Criticality | Stocking Strategy | Reorder Trigger |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Critical (no alternative) | Safety stock on-site | Below minimum + lead time buffer |
| Important (workaround exists) | Regional depot stock | Below reorder point |
| Standard (commodity) | Supplier agreement | Just-in-time ordering |

## Work Order Integration

Every predictive maintenance recommendation generates a work order containing:

- Asset ID and location
- Predicted failure mode and confidence level
- Recommended action and urgency
- Required parts, tools, and skills
- Estimated duration
- RUL window (earliest and latest recommended completion)

## Common Pitfalls

### Over-Maintaining

Wrong: Replace a component at 50% remaining useful life "just to be safe."

Right: Optimize the intervention point. Early replacement wastes remaining life and increases costs.

### Ignoring Scheduling Constraints

Wrong: Model recommends maintenance Tuesday; plant runs 24/7 with no planned shutdowns.

Right: Integrate maintenance recommendations with production scheduling and constraint systems.
