# Sensor Analytics

Guidelines for ingesting, processing, and analyzing industrial sensor data streams.

## Sensor Types and Data Characteristics

| Sensor Type | Measurement | Typical Frequency | Key Patterns |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Vibration | Acceleration (g) | 1-10 kHz | Harmonics, bearing defects |
| Temperature | Degrees C/F | 1-60 sec intervals | Thermal trends, hotspots |
| Pressure | PSI/Bar | 1-10 sec intervals | Leak detection, blockages |
| Current/Voltage | Amps/Volts | 1-60 sec intervals | Motor degradation |
| Flow rate | Volume/time | 1-60 sec intervals | Blockages, pump wear |
| Acoustic | Decibels, frequency | 1-10 kHz | Cavitation, looseness |
| Oil analysis | Particle count, viscosity | Daily-Monthly | Wear debris, contamination |

## Data Quality Requirements

- **Completeness**: Flag gaps > 5 minutes; interpolate gaps < 1 minute
- **Accuracy**: Validate against known reference points quarterly
- **Timeliness**: Edge-to-analysis latency < 30 seconds for critical assets
- **Consistency**: Normalize units across sensor vendors and asset types

## Feature Engineering

Key derived features for failure prediction:

- **Rolling statistics**: Mean, std dev, min, max over 1h/24h/7d windows
- **Rate of change**: First and second derivatives of key measurements
- **Frequency domain**: FFT for vibration, acoustic data
- **Cross-sensor correlations**: Temperature-vibration, pressure-flow relationships
- **Operating context**: Load level, ambient conditions, time since last maintenance

## Edge Processing Rules

- Filter obvious noise (sensor reboot spikes, communication errors)
- Apply calibration offsets at the edge before transmission
- Aggregate high-frequency data to summary statistics for long-term storage
- Forward raw data only when anomaly triggers require investigation

## Common Pitfalls

### Ignoring Sensor Drift

Wrong: Assume sensor readings are accurate indefinitely.

Right: Schedule sensor calibration checks. Track measurement drift and apply corrections.

### Drowning in Data

Wrong: Store every raw reading at maximum frequency forever.

Right: Tier storage: raw data for 30 days, summary statistics for 2 years, anomaly events permanently.
