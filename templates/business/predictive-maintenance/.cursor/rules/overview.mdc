# Predictive Maintenance

Principal-level guidelines for sensor-driven failure prediction and maintenance optimization.

## Scope

This ruleset applies to:

- Sensor data ingestion and real-time processing
- Failure prediction and anomaly detection
- Maintenance scheduling optimization
- Asset lifecycle management
- Alert systems and severity classification
- CMMS/EAM system integration

## Core Philosophy

**Every unplanned breakdown is a failure of the monitoring system.** The goal is to detect degradation gradients early enough to schedule maintenance at the optimal economic moment - not too early (wasting remaining useful life) and not too late (risking catastrophic failure).

## Fundamental Principles

### 1. Predict, Don't React

Shift from time-based schedules to condition-based triggers. Maintain equipment based on what the data says, not what the calendar says.

### 2. False Alarms Kill Trust

A model that cries wolf will be ignored when the turbine actually fails. Optimize for precision alongside recall.

### 3. Degradation Is Gradual, Failure Is Sudden

Detect the degradation curve before it hits the cliff. Trend analysis matters more than point-in-time thresholds.

### 4. Maintenance Is an Economic Decision

Every intervention has a cost; every deferral has a risk. Optimize the tradeoff between maintenance expense and failure consequence.

### 5. Context Over Raw Data

Sensor readings without asset history, operating conditions, and failure mode context are meaningless noise.

## Decision Framework

When evaluating a maintenance signal:

1. **Confidence**: What is the model's certainty? Is this a known failure pattern?
2. **Consequence**: What happens if this asset fails? Safety, production, cost impact?
3. **Remaining Useful Life**: How much operating time remains before probable failure?
4. **Maintenance Window**: When is the next feasible maintenance opportunity?
5. **Cost Tradeoff**: Is preventive action cheaper than the expected cost of failure?
