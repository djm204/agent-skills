## Valuation Alignment Mechanisms

When buyer and seller disagree on value, use contingent structures:

| Mechanism | When to Use | Risk Allocation |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| Earnouts | Revenue/EBITDA uncertainty | Seller bears performance risk |
| Escrow holdbacks | Representation risk | Seller bears warranty risk |
| Milestone payments | Product or regulatory milestones | Shared risk on execution |
| Working capital adjustments | Balance sheet uncertainty | Factual true-up, minimal risk |
| CVRs (Contingent Value Rights) | Binary event outcomes | Seller retains upside optionality |
| Seller notes | Financing gap | Buyer credit risk to seller |

## Earnout Design Principles

Earnouts are the most contentious post-close mechanism. Design them carefully:

1. **Metric clarity**: Use unambiguous, auditable metrics (revenue, not "adjusted EBITDA")
2. **Measurement period**: 12-24 months is typical; longer creates more disputes
3. **Operating covenants**: Specify how the business must be operated during the period
4. **Ceiling and floor**: Cap maximum payout and set minimum thresholds
5. **Dispute resolution**: Pre-agree on accounting firm and arbitration procedure
6. **Acceleration triggers**: Define what happens on change of control or material breach

## Indemnification Framework

| Element | Seller-Friendly | Buyer-Friendly | Market Norm |
|---------|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Cap | 5-10% of deal value | 50-100% of deal value | 10-25% |
| Basket type | Tipping basket | True deductible | Deal-size dependent |
| Basket threshold | 1.5-2% of deal value | 0.25-0.5% of deal value | 0.5-1% |
| Survival (general) | 12 months | 36 months | 18-24 months |
| Survival (fundamental) | 24 months | Indefinite | Statute of limitations |
| Escrow | 5% for 12 months | 15-20% for 24 months | 8-15% for 18 months |

## Term Trade-Off Strategy

Never negotiate terms in isolation. Use trades across term categories:

### High-Value Trades

| Concession | In Exchange For |
|-----------|----------------|
| Higher purchase price | Stronger rep and warranty package |
| Broader indemnification | Larger escrow with faster release |
| Shorter non-compete period | Tighter customer non-solicitation |
| Flexible payment schedule | Stronger MAC clause protections |
| Wider earn-out targets | Stricter operating covenants |

### Package Negotiation

Always present offers as complete packages, not individual terms:

- **Package A**: Lower price, minimal earnout, strong protections
- **Package B**: Higher price, meaningful earnout, moderate protections
- **Package C**: Highest price, large earnout, lighter protections

This forces the counterparty to evaluate trade-offs rather than cherry-picking.

## Tax Structure Considerations

| Structure | Seller Tax Impact | Buyer Tax Benefit |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| Asset purchase | Ordinary income on some assets | Step-up in basis, depreciation |
| Stock purchase | Capital gains treatment | No step-up (unless 338(h)(10)) |
| 338(h)(10) election | Treated as asset sale for tax | Step-up in basis |
| Tax-free reorganization | Deferral of gain | Carryover basis |
| Installment sale | Spread recognition over time | Deferred payments |

## Common Pitfalls

### Over-Engineering Earnouts

Wrong: Create complex multi-metric earnout formulas that require an accounting degree to calculate.

Right: Simple, measurable, auditable metrics with clear payment triggers. If you cannot explain the earnout in two sentences, simplify it.

### Ignoring Integration in Deal Terms

Wrong: Negotiate the deal in isolation and figure out integration after signing.

Right: Integration requirements should inform deal structure. Transition services agreements, employee retention terms, and system migration timelines are negotiation items, not afterthoughts.
