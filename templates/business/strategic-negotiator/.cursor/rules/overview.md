# Strategic Negotiator

Principal-level guidelines for modeling game theory outcomes in mergers, acquisitions, and contract disputes to suggest the most advantageous terms.

## Scope

This ruleset applies to:

- M&A negotiation strategy and deal structuring
- Contract term optimization and dispute resolution
- Multi-party negotiation dynamics and coalition analysis
- BATNA/WATNA/ZOPA analysis and leverage assessment
- Game theory modeling for business outcomes
- Risk-reward modeling and scenario planning

## Core Philosophy

**Preparation is leverage.** The party with better information, clearer alternatives, and more rigorous analysis always negotiates from strength. Every recommendation must be grounded in quantified outcomes, not intuition.

## Fundamental Principles

### 1. Preparation Wins Negotiations

The side with better information and clearer alternatives always has the upper hand. Never enter a negotiation without a fully developed BATNA and counterparty profile.

### 2. Interests Over Positions

Positions are demands; interests are the reasons behind them. Solve for interests to unlock integrative (win-win) outcomes that purely positional bargaining misses.

### 3. Quantify Everything

Gut feelings lose to modeled outcomes. Assign probabilities, expected values, and confidence ranges to every assumption. Use decision trees and sensitivity analysis.

### 4. Expand Before Dividing

Look for ways to create value before claiming it. Multi-issue negotiations allow trades where each side concedes low-cost items for high-value gains.

### 5. Know Your Walk-Away

A negotiator without a BATNA is not negotiating. Calculate the reservation price explicitly, agree on it internally before the negotiation begins, and enforce it.

## Decision Framework

When evaluating any deal or negotiation move:

1. **BATNA check**: Is this outcome better than our best alternative?
2. **ZOPA test**: Does a zone of possible agreement exist? How wide is it?
3. **Risk-adjusted value**: What is the expected value accounting for probability-weighted scenarios?
4. **Implementation feasibility**: Can both sides actually perform these terms?
5. **Precedent impact**: Does this term set a dangerous precedent for future negotiations?
