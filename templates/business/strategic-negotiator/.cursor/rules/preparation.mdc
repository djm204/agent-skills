# Preparation

Guidelines for thorough negotiation preparation, counterparty profiling, and pre-negotiation strategy development.

## Preparation Framework

```text
Negotiation Preparation Checklist
├── Self-Assessment
│   ├── Identify and rank our interests (not positions)
│   ├── Calculate our BATNA and reservation price
│   ├── Set target/aspiration price with justification
│   ├── Inventory concessions we can make (with internal costs)
│   ├── Define authority limits (who approves what)
│   └── Identify our constraints and pressure points
├── Counterparty Analysis
│   ├── Research their interests and priorities
│   ├── Estimate their BATNA
│   ├── Assess their constraints and timeline pressures
│   ├── Profile decision makers (style, authority, biases)
│   ├── Review their past negotiation behavior
│   └── Map their internal stakeholder dynamics
├── ZOPA Construction
│   ├── Estimate zone of possible agreement
│   ├── Identify ZOPA expansion opportunities
│   ├── Prepare multiple package proposals
│   └── Design contingent agreements for uncertainty
├── Strategy Design
│   ├── Choose opening strategy (anchor, listen first, or package)
│   ├── Plan concession pattern and pace
│   ├── Prepare responses to likely counterparty moves
│   ├── Define walk-away criteria and process
│   └── Assign team roles and communication protocols
└── Logistics
    ├── Set agenda and sequencing preferences
    ├── Choose venue and format
    ├── Prepare documents and data room
    ├── Brief legal and financial advisors
    └── Establish internal communication plan
```

## Counterparty Profiling

### Information Gathering

| Category | Sources | Key Questions |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Financial position | Public filings, credit reports, press releases | Cash reserves? Debt covenants? Quarterly pressure? |
| Strategic priorities | Annual reports, CEO letters, investor presentations | Growth targets? Divestiture plans? Adjacency strategy? |
| Negotiation history | News archives, industry contacts, legal databases | Past deal terms? Litigation patterns? Walk-away record? |
| Decision process | Organizational charts, board composition, governance docs | Who decides? Consensus or hierarchy? Board approval needed? |
| Cultural factors | Regional norms, industry customs, personal style | Relationship-first or transactional? Direct or indirect? |

### Negotiation Style Assessment

| Style | Indicators | Counter-Strategy |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Competitive | Positional demands, take-it-or-leave-it, deadline pressure | Hold firm on walk-away, redirect to interests, slow the pace |
| Collaborative | Interest-based questions, creative options, transparency | Reciprocate openness cautiously, but verify claims independently |
| Avoidant | Delayed responses, delegation, process objections | Set deadlines, escalate to decision makers, present clear alternatives |
| Accommodating | Quick concessions, relationship focus, conflict avoidance | Do not exploit (if repeated game), test their limits gently |
| Analytical | Data requests, scenario analysis, detailed due diligence | Prepare rigorous supporting data, expect longer timelines |

## Anchoring Strategy

### When to Anchor First

Anchor first (make the opening offer) when:

- You have strong information about the ZOPA
- The counterparty has weaker information
- Industry norms support a specific range
- You want to frame the negotiation around your terms

### When to Let Them Anchor

Let them go first when:

- You have limited information about their valuation
- Their anchor may reveal more than yours
- You expect their anchor to be within your acceptable range
- Listening first yields strategic intelligence

### Anchor Calibration

- Set anchor **ambitiously but defensibly** (can you justify it with data?)
- Expect **30-50% of the distance** between anchor and counterparty's target as final outcome
- Prepare **supporting rationale** (comparables, precedent, market data) for your anchor
- Never anchor with a round number; precision signals preparation (say $47.5M, not "around $50M")

## Concession Strategy

### Concession Planning Table

| Concession | Our Cost | Their Perceived Value | Priority (give early/late) |
|-----------|----------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| [Item 1] | [Low/Med/High] | [Low/Med/High] | [Early - builds goodwill] |
| [Item 2] | [Low/Med/High] | [Low/Med/High] | [Late - save for closing] |
| [Item 3] | [Low/Med/High] | [Low/Med/High] | [Trade for specific return] |

### Concession Principles

1. **Never concede without getting something back** (reciprocity principle)
2. **Make concessions progressively smaller** (signals approaching your limit)
3. **Label your concessions** ("This is important to us, but we are willing to...")
4. **Track all concessions** by both sides (running scorecard)
5. **Never split the difference** as a first move (it rewards extreme opening positions)

## Team Roles

| Role | Responsibility | Skills Required |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| Lead negotiator | Primary spokesperson, relationship management | Communication, judgment |
| Analyst | Real-time modeling, number verification | Financial modeling, quick math |
| Observer | Read counterparty body language and dynamics | Emotional intelligence, note-taking |
| Scribe | Document proposals, counterproposals, commitments | Precision, organization |
| Specialist | Answer technical/legal/financial questions | Domain expertise |

## War-Gaming

Before the negotiation, simulate it:

1. **Assign red team** to play the counterparty using their estimated strategy
2. **Run through 3 rounds** of offers, counteroffers, and objections
3. **Identify surprises** and weak points in your strategy
4. **Refine responses** to the most challenging counterparty moves
5. **Practice walk-away** to ensure the team can execute it under pressure

## Common Pitfalls

### Underestimating Preparation Time

Wrong: Schedule a "quick prep call" the morning of the negotiation.

Right: Major negotiations require days to weeks of preparation. The ratio of preparation time to negotiation time should be at least 3:1.

### Preparing Only Your Side

Wrong: Build a detailed model of your own position and walk in blind about the counterparty.

Right: Spend at least half your preparation time on counterparty analysis. Understanding their constraints and interests is as important as knowing your own.

### Rigid Scripting

Wrong: Write a negotiation script and follow it regardless of what happens.

Right: Prepare principles, ranges, and contingency responses. Be adaptive in execution while staying disciplined on strategy.
