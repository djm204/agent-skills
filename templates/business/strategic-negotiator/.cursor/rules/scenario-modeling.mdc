## Decision Tree Construction

### Building a Negotiation Decision Tree

1. **Root node**: Your opening decision (accept, reject, counter)
2. **Chance nodes**: Counterparty responses with estimated probabilities
3. **Decision nodes**: Your subsequent choices at each stage
4. **Terminal nodes**: Final outcomes with dollar values
5. **Solve backward**: Calculate expected values from terminal nodes to root

### Probability Estimation

| Confidence Level | Source | Typical Use |
|-----------------|--------|------------|
| High (narrow range) | Historical data, precedent transactions | Mature markets, repeat deals |
| Medium (moderate range) | Expert judgment, analogous situations | Novel but similar contexts |
| Low (wide range) | Speculation, limited data | First-of-kind deals, new markets |

When confidence is low, widen probability ranges and run more scenarios. Do not fake precision.

## Monte Carlo Simulation

For deals with many continuous uncertainties, use Monte Carlo:

1. **Define input distributions** for each uncertain variable (revenue growth, synergy capture, integration cost)
2. **Specify correlations** between inputs (do not assume independence without justification)
3. **Run 10,000+ iterations** to build output distributions
4. **Analyze results** as probability distributions, not single point estimates

### Key Outputs

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|------------------|
| Mean outcome | Expected deal value |
| Median outcome | Most likely single outcome |
| Standard deviation | Outcome volatility |
| 5th percentile | Downside scenario (Value at Risk) |
| 95th percentile | Upside scenario |
| Probability of loss | Chance deal destroys value |

## Sensitivity Analysis

Rank assumptions by their impact on deal value:

1. Vary each assumption independently across its plausible range
2. Hold all other assumptions at base case
3. Record the swing in outcome value
4. Rank from largest swing to smallest
5. Focus negotiation efforts on the top 3-5 value drivers

### Two-Way Sensitivity Tables

For the two most impactful assumptions, build a matrix:

```text
                 Revenue Growth
                 Low    Base   High
Synergy   Low  | $80M  $95M   $110M |
Capture   Base | $95M  $115M  $135M |
          High | $110M $135M  $160M |
```

This reveals which assumption combinations are dangerous and which are windfalls.

## Scenario Analysis Framework

### Four-Scenario Template

For the two highest-impact uncertainties, construct four futures:

| Scenario | Axis 1: High | Axis 1: Low |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Axis 2: High | Best case (quantify) | Mixed case A (quantify) |
| Axis 2: Low | Mixed case B (quantify) | Worst case (quantify) |

For each scenario, document:

- Probability estimate (must sum to ~100%)
- Deal value under this scenario
- Optimal deal terms for this scenario
- Early warning indicators
- Contingency response

### Robust vs. Contingent Strategies

- **Robust strategy**: Performs acceptably (not necessarily optimally) across all scenarios
- **Contingent strategy**: Optimal in a specific scenario but may fail in others
- **Preferred approach**: Build a robust base strategy with contingent options (earn-outs, triggers, options) that activate if specific scenarios materialize

## Stress Testing

### Deal-Breaker Analysis

For each proposed deal structure, test against these stress scenarios:

| Stress Test | Question | Threshold |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| Revenue collapse | What if revenue drops 30% post-close? | Does the deal still create value? |
| Synergy failure | What if only 50% of synergies materialize? | Is the price still justified? |
| Key person loss | What if the CEO/CTO leaves in month 3? | Are retention terms adequate? |
| Market downturn | What if multiples compress 25%? | Is the financing structure safe? |
| Regulatory block | What if approval takes 18+ months? | Can both sides sustain the interim? |
| Integration delay | What if integration takes 2x the planned time? | What are the cash flow implications? |

## Common Pitfalls

### False Precision

Wrong: Present a deal value of $147.3M based on assumptions with plus-or-minus 30% uncertainty.

Right: Present as a range ($100M to $195M) with a base case of $147M. Communicate uncertainty honestly.

### Scenario Blindness

Wrong: Build three scenarios (optimistic, base, pessimistic) that are all mild variations of each other.

Right: Make scenarios genuinely different. The worst case should be uncomfortable. The best case should feel ambitious. Test real extremes.

### Anchoring on Base Case

Wrong: Treat the base case as the likely outcome and scenarios as theoretical exercises.

Right: Weight all scenarios by probability. If the downside scenario is 30% likely and catastrophic, that matters more than a 40% base case that is merely good.
