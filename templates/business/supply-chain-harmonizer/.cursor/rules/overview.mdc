# Supply Chain Harmonizer

Principal-level guidelines for autonomous disruption response, shipment rerouting, inventory rebalancing, and stakeholder communication across multi-tier supply networks.

## Scope

This ruleset applies to:

- Real-time disruption detection and severity classification
- Automated rerouting of shipments around blocked or degraded routes
- Multi-tier supplier network monitoring and failover
- Inventory rebalancing across warehouse networks
- Stakeholder notification cascades
- Scenario simulation and resilience planning

## Core Philosophy

**The supply chain acts, then reports.** When a port closes, the system does not wait for a human to decide what to do. It reroutes shipments, adjusts inventory, and notifies stakeholders autonomously. Human approval is reserved for high-cost exceptions, not standard disruption response.

## Fundamental Principles

### 1. Autonomy Over Escalation

The system resolves S3-S5 disruptions without human intervention. S1 and S2 disruptions trigger autonomous containment while simultaneously escalating for oversight. Waiting for approval is a form of failure.

### 2. Resilience Over Efficiency

A resilient supply chain costs more during calm periods and dramatically less during storms. Optimize for total cost of ownership across disruption scenarios, not steady-state unit cost.

### 3. Cascade Awareness

Every disruption has secondary effects. A port closure does not just delay shipments; it congests alternate ports, depletes safety stock, and shifts demand patterns. Model the full cascade, not just the initial event.

### 4. Time Is Inventory

Every hour of unresolved disruption burns safety stock somewhere in the network. Response speed is not an operational metric; it is a financial metric measured in dollars of inventory consumed and revenue lost.

### 5. Recovery Is the Metric

Detection speed means nothing if recovery is slow. Optimize the entire chain: detect, classify, respond, stabilize, recover, learn.

## Decision Framework

When evaluating any supply chain disruption:

1. **Severity**: How many routes, shipments, and SKUs are affected?
2. **Duration**: How long will this disruption persist? What is the confidence range?
3. **Blast Radius**: What downstream customers and upstream suppliers are impacted?
4. **Options**: What rerouting, rebalancing, and sourcing alternatives exist?
5. **Cost**: What is the cost of action vs. the cost of inaction per hour?
6. **Recovery**: What does the path to full service restoration look like?

## Autonomy Boundaries

| Severity | Autonomous Actions | Human Required |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| S4-S5 | Full resolution, log only | None |
| S3 | Reroute, rebalance, notify | Review within 24 hours |
| S2 | Reroute, rebalance, notify, escalate | Approve cost overruns > 25% |
| S1 | Containment actions, full escalation | Strategic decisions, external comms |
