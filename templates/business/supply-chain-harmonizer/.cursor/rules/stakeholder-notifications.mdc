# Stakeholder Notifications

Guidelines for cascading disruption communications to the right people through the right channels at the right time.

## Notification Cascade

Notifications are tiered by urgency and audience:

| Tier | Timing | Recipients |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Immediate | < 15 minutes | Operations control center, affected warehouse managers, on-call supply chain lead |
| Fast | < 1 hour | Procurement (if supplier-related), logistics partners, customer service, VP Supply Chain (S1/S2) |
| Standard | < 4 hours | Affected retailers and key accounts, sales team, finance team, executive leadership (S1 only) |
| Periodic | Daily until resolved | Status update to all previously notified parties |

## Channel Selection

| Stakeholder | S1 Channel | S2 Channel | S3+ Channel |
|------------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Executive leadership | Phone + SMS + Email | Email + Dashboard | Dashboard only |
| Operations team | SMS + Slack + Dashboard | Slack + Dashboard | Dashboard only |
| Warehouse managers | SMS + WMS alert | WMS alert + Email | WMS alert |
| Logistics partners | API + Email + Phone | API + Email | API notification |
| Retailers and customers | Phone + Email | Email | Email (if ETA changes) |
| Finance team | Email | Email | Weekly report |

Higher severity always uses higher-urgency channels. Never send an S1 notification by email alone.

## Content Requirements

Every disruption notification must include:

1. **What happened**: Clear, factual description of the disruption
2. **What is affected**: Specific routes, shipments, SKUs, or orders impacted
3. **What we are doing**: Actions already taken (autonomous) and actions planned
4. **Revised timeline**: Updated ETAs or service level expectations
5. **What they need to do**: Specific decisions or actions required from the recipient
6. **Next update**: When the next communication will be sent

Avoid jargon with external stakeholders. Retailers do not need to know which rerouting algorithm was used; they need to know when their order arrives.

## Escalation Rules

- If a notification is not acknowledged within 30 minutes (S1) or 2 hours (S2), automatically escalate to the next level in the recipient's chain of command
- If three consecutive S3+ disruptions affect the same stakeholder within 30 days, schedule a proactive resilience review call
- If the recovery timeline extends beyond the initial estimate by more than 50%, send an updated notification immediately regardless of the periodic schedule

## Notification Fatigue Prevention

- **Role-based filtering**: Each stakeholder role has a defined severity threshold; do not send below it
- **Aggregation**: Multiple S4/S5 events in the same region within a 24-hour window are batched into a single daily summary
- **Deduplication**: If the same disruption is detected from multiple sources, send one notification, not one per source
- **Quiet hours**: S4 and S5 notifications respect business hours unless they escalate to S3+

## Feedback Loop

After every S1 or S2 disruption, survey notification recipients:

- Was the notification timely?
- Was the information sufficient for decision-making?
- Was the channel appropriate?
- What would you change?

Incorporate feedback into cascade configuration quarterly.

## Common Pitfalls

### Notifying Everyone About Everything

Wrong: Send every disruption alert to every stakeholder. Executives receive 50 supply chain notifications a day.

Right: Match notification severity to stakeholder role. Executives see only S1 and S2. Warehouse managers see only events affecting their location.

### Technical Jargon in Customer Communications

Wrong: Tell a retailer that "AIS data indicates vessel diversion from Ningbo to Busan due to typhoon-class weather event affecting East China Sea shipping lanes."

Right: Tell a retailer that "Due to severe weather, your shipment is being rerouted and the revised delivery date is [date]. No action is needed from you at this time."

### Missing the Periodic Update

Wrong: Send the initial disruption alert and then go silent until the problem is resolved.

Right: Send daily updates for the duration of the disruption, even if the update is "no change from yesterday." Silence breeds uncertainty.
