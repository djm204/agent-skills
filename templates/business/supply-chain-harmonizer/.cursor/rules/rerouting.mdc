# Rerouting

Guidelines for automated shipment rerouting when primary routes are disrupted.

## Decision Tree

When a route is blocked or degraded:

1. **Evaluate alternate routes** using the scoring algorithm
2. **If cost delta < 25%**: Auto-approve and execute
3. **If cost delta 25-50%**: Auto-approve with executive notification
4. **If cost delta > 50%**: Hold for human approval (max 4-hour hold)
5. **If no alternate route exists**: Evaluate alternate suppliers or escalate to war room

For potential delays (not yet blocked):

1. **If delay risk > 48 hours**: Begin preemptive reroute evaluation
2. **If delay risk < 48 hours**: Monitor and reassess every 6 hours

## Route Scoring

Each alternative route is scored on five weighted factors:

| Factor | Weight | Metric |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Transit time | 30% | Hours to destination vs. original ETA |
| Cost | 25% | Incremental cost as percentage of shipment value |
| Reliability | 20% | Historical on-time rate for this lane |
| Capacity | 15% | Available capacity vs. shipment volume needed |
| Risk exposure | 10% | Known risk factors currently active on route |

Minimum acceptable composite score: 60 out of 100. Below this threshold, the route is rejected and the next alternative is evaluated.

## Modal Switching

When the original transport mode is unavailable, fall back in this order:

| Original Mode | Fallback 1 | Fallback 2 | Fallback 3 |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Ocean freight | Rail (continental) | Air freight (high-value) | Truck (regional) |
| Air freight | Express ocean | Truck relay | Charter flight |
| Rail | Truck | Intermodal ocean-truck | Air (critical only) |
| Truck | Rail | Intermodal | Courier (small parcels) |

Air freight is reserved for high-value or time-critical shipments where the cost premium is justified by the revenue at risk.

## Constraints Checklist

Before executing any reroute, verify:

- **Regulatory compliance**: Goods can legally transit all countries on the new route
- **Temperature requirements**: Cold chain integrity maintained across all segments
- **Weight and volume limits**: New mode and route can handle the cargo dimensions
- **Customs implications**: New transit countries do not add excessive clearance delays
- **Contractual obligations**: Rerouting does not violate minimum volume commitments on original lane
- **Insurance coverage**: Cargo insurance valid for the new route and mode

## Rerouting Record

Every rerouting decision must be logged with:

- Original route and ETA
- Disruption that triggered the reroute
- Alternatives evaluated and their scores
- Selected alternative and rationale
- Cost delta and approval status
- Revised ETA communicated to stakeholders
- Actual delivery outcome (post-completion)

## Common Pitfalls

### Cheapest Route Bias

Wrong: Always select the lowest-cost reroute regardless of reliability.

Right: Use the weighted scoring algorithm. A $500 cheaper route that has a 60% on-time rate will likely cost more in the end.

### Rerouting Into Congestion

Wrong: Divert all shipments to the same alternate port, creating a secondary bottleneck.

Right: Monitor capacity at alternate nodes. Distribute rerouted volume across multiple alternatives when possible.

### Forgetting to Revert

Wrong: Leave shipments on expensive alternate routes after the primary route recovers.

Right: Set automated triggers to revert to primary routes once disruption is resolved and route is confirmed stable for 48+ hours.
