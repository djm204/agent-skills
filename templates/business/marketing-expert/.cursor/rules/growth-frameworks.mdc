# Growth Frameworks

Guidelines for designing growth loops, running experimentation programs, optimizing retention, and scaling sustainable growth.

## Growth Model Selection

| Model | Description | Best For |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Sales-Led Growth (SLG) | Dedicated sales team drives acquisition | Enterprise, high ACV, complex products |
| Marketing-Led Growth (MLG) | Content, ads, and nurture drive pipeline | Mid-market, moderate ACV, education-heavy |
| Product-Led Growth (PLG) | Product itself drives acquisition and conversion | Low ACV, self-serve, high volume |
| Community-Led Growth (CLG) | Community creates content, referrals, and trust | Developer tools, platforms, niche markets |
| Partner-Led Growth | Channel partners drive distribution | Geographic expansion, regulated industries |

## Growth Loop Design

```text
Growth Loop Anatomy
├── Input
│   ├── What triggers the loop?
│   ├── New user signup, content creation, purchase
│   └── Must be a natural part of the product experience
├── Action
│   ├── What does the user do?
│   ├── Share, invite, create, review, integrate
│   └── Must deliver value to the user, not just the company
├── Output
│   ├── What result does the action create?
│   ├── New content, new users, data improvement
│   └── Must feed back into the input of the loop
└── Amplifier
    ├── What accelerates the loop?
    ├── Incentives, network effects, algorithmic distribution
    └── Must compound, not just add linearly
```

### Loop Health Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Healthy Range |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Cycle time | Time for one complete loop iteration | Hours to days (shorter is better) |
| Conversion rate | % of loop participants who complete the action | Varies by loop type; track trend |
| K-factor (viral) | Average new users generated per existing user | > 1.0 for viral growth, > 0.3 for assist |
| Loop efficiency | Output value / input cost | Increasing over time |
| Decay rate | How quickly the loop weakens without investment | Slower decay = more durable loop |

## AARRR Deep Dive

### Acquisition Optimization

| Lever | Tactic | Metric |
|-------|--------|--------|
| SEO | Publish problem-solution content at scale | Organic traffic, keyword rankings |
| Paid | Test channels, optimize bids and targeting | CAC, ROAS, incremental pipeline |
| Viral | Build sharing and invitation into product | K-factor, invite conversion rate |
| Community | Foster user-generated content and discussion | Community growth rate, referral traffic |
| Partnerships | Co-market with complementary products | Partner-sourced leads, co-branded traffic |

### Activation Optimization

| Lever | Tactic | Metric |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Onboarding | Reduce steps to first value moment | Time to value, onboarding completion |
| Quick wins | Guide users to an "aha moment" fast | Feature adoption within first session |
| Personalization | Tailor experience based on signup data | Activation rate by segment |
| Education | In-app guides, tooltips, and walkthroughs | Help engagement, support ticket reduction |
| Social proof | Show what similar users achieved | Activation rate uplift |

### Retention Framework

```text
Retention Strategy Layers
├── Short-Term (Day 1-7)
│   ├── Onboarding completion
│   ├── First value delivery
│   ├── Welcome email sequence
│   └── Quick win achievement
├── Medium-Term (Week 2-8)
│   ├── Habit formation loops
│   ├── Feature discovery campaigns
│   ├── Community onboarding
│   └── Use case expansion
├── Long-Term (Month 3+)
│   ├── Workflow integration (switching cost)
│   ├── Data accumulation (value increases over time)
│   ├── Team expansion (more users = more value)
│   └── Regular product launches (renewed interest)
└── Recovery
    ├── Churn prediction scoring
    ├── Re-engagement campaigns
    ├── Win-back offers
    └── Exit interviews for learning
```

## Experimentation Program

| Component | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| Idea backlog | Central repository for experiment ideas from all teams |
| Prioritization | ICE scoring (Impact, Confidence, Ease) applied weekly |
| Velocity target | Minimum number of experiments per sprint (e.g., 2-3/week) |
| Documentation | Every experiment logged with hypothesis, results, learnings |
| Review cadence | Weekly experiment review with cross-functional stakeholders |
| Knowledge base | Searchable archive of past experiments and outcomes |

### ICE Scoring Guide

| Score | Impact | Confidence | Ease |
|-------|--------|-----------|------|
| 10 | Massive uplift (> 25%) | Proven in similar context | Ship today, no eng needed |
| 7-9 | Large uplift (10-25%) | Strong evidence it will work | 1-2 days effort |
| 4-6 | Moderate uplift (5-10%) | Reasonable hypothesis | 1-2 weeks effort |
| 1-3 | Small uplift (< 5%) | Pure guess | Major effort, cross-team |

## Scaling Checklist

| Milestone | Criteria | Next Action |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Channel works | Positive ROI with small budget (< $5K/month) | Increase budget 2-3x |
| Channel scales | ROI holds at 2-3x budget | Continue scaling, test creative variants |
| Channel saturates | Diminishing returns at higher spend | Cap spend, find next channel |
| Loop works | One complete loop cycle observed | Reduce friction, measure cycle time |
| Loop compounds | Output exceeds input consistently | Invest in amplifiers, remove bottlenecks |

## Common Pitfalls

### Premature Optimization

Wrong: Spend weeks optimizing a landing page conversion rate before validating that the traffic source sends qualified visitors.

Right: Validate the full loop first. Ensure the right people arrive, experience value, and convert before optimizing any single step.

### Growth Hacking Without Strategy

Wrong: Chase viral tactics and hacks without a coherent growth model. Pursue short-term spikes that do not compound.

Right: Design a sustainable growth loop first. Then use experimentation to optimize each step of the loop systematically.

### Ignoring Retention

Wrong: Celebrate new user acquisition while monthly active users remain flat because churn matches growth.

Right: Measure net growth (new users minus churned users). Fix the retention floor before pouring more into the acquisition ceiling.

### Copying Without Context

Wrong: Adopt another company's growth playbook because they grew fast. Implement their referral program, pricing model, and onboarding without adapting.

Right: Understand the principles behind successful growth strategies. Adapt the principles to your product, audience, and stage. Context determines what works.
