## Segmentation Framework

| Step | Activity | Output |
|------|----------|--------|
| Define variables | Choose segmentation dimensions (firmographic, behavioral, needs-based) | Variable list with definitions |
| Collect data | Gather data on potential customers across variables | Customer dataset |
| Cluster analysis | Group customers with similar profiles | Segment definitions |
| Profile segments | Describe each segment's characteristics, size, and needs | Segment profiles |
| Evaluate segments | Score attractiveness: size, growth, accessibility, fit | Prioritized segment list |
| Select targets | Choose segments to pursue based on strategy | Target segment decisions |

### Segment Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Market size | 20% | Revenue potential of the segment |
| Growth rate | 15% | Year-over-year segment growth |
| Competitive intensity | 15% | Number and strength of competitors serving this segment |
| Accessibility | 15% | Ability to reach and serve the segment with current resources |
| Strategic fit | 15% | Alignment with company capabilities and vision |
| Willingness to pay | 10% | Price sensitivity and budget availability |
| Switching costs | 10% | Barriers to leaving current solution |

## Market Sizing Methods

| Method | Approach | Best For |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Top-Down | Start with total market, apply filters | TAM estimation, investor presentations |
| Bottom-Up | Start with unit economics, multiply by reachable customers | SOM estimation, revenue planning |
| Value Theory | Estimate total value delivered, capture percentage | New categories with no existing market data |
| Analog | Use comparable market as proxy | Emerging markets with limited data |

### Sizing Template

```markdown
## Market Sizing: [Market Name]

**Date**: [Date]
**Method**: [Top-Down / Bottom-Up / Value Theory]

### TAM (Total Addressable Market)
| Input | Value | Source |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Total potential customers | [#] | [Source] |
| Average annual spend | [$] | [Source] |
| **TAM** | **[$]** | Customers x Spend |

### SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)
| Filter | Reduction | Remaining |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Geographic reach | [%] | [$] |
| Segment fit | [%] | [$] |
| Channel access | [%] | [$] |
| **SAM** | | **[$]** |

### SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)
| Factor | Assumption | Value |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Year 1 market share target | [%] | [$] |
| Year 3 market share target | [%] | [$] |
| Sales capacity constraint | [# reps x quota] | [$] |
| **SOM (Year 1)** | | **[$]** |
```

## Competitive Analysis Framework

| Analysis Type | Focus | Sources | Frequency |
|--------------|-------|---------|-----------|
| Feature comparison | Product capabilities | Product demos, documentation, reviews | Quarterly |
| Pricing analysis | Price points, packaging, discounting | Public pricing, sales intel, win/loss | Quarterly |
| Positioning audit | Messaging, claims, target audience | Website, ads, content, press | Semi-annual |
| GTM analysis | Channels, partnerships, sales motion | Job postings, news, partner directories | Quarterly |
| Financial health | Revenue, growth, funding, burn rate | SEC filings, press releases, estimates | Quarterly |
| Technology audit | Tech stack, architecture, patents | Job postings, documentation, patents | Semi-annual |

## Win/Loss Analysis

| Data Point | Source | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Why they chose us | Customer interviews | Validate positioning and strengths |
| Why they chose competitor | Lost prospect interviews | Identify gaps and competitive weaknesses |
| Decision criteria ranking | Both winners and losers | Understand what buyers actually value |
| Evaluation process | Sales team debrief | Improve sales process and materials |
| Competitor mentions | CRM data, call recordings | Track competitive frequency |

## Common Pitfalls

### Analysis Paralysis

Wrong: Spend 6 months on market research before making any strategic decisions. Require certainty before acting.

Right: Time-box research to 2-4 weeks. Make decisions with 70% confidence. Use real market feedback to fill the remaining 30%.

### Confirmation Bias in Research

Wrong: Design survey questions that lead respondents toward your desired answer. Only interview customers who love your product.

Right: Ask open-ended questions. Interview churned customers and lost deals. Actively seek disconfirming data.

### Static Market View

Wrong: Treat a market analysis from 18 months ago as current. Assume segments and competitors have not changed.

Right: Refresh competitive intelligence quarterly. Re-validate segment assumptions annually. Markets move faster than PowerPoint decks.

### Ignoring Adjacent Markets

Wrong: Only monitor direct competitors. Miss the startup three categories away that is about to redefine your market.

Right: Monitor adjacent markets, emerging technologies, and cross-industry trends. Disruption usually comes from outside your current competitive set.
