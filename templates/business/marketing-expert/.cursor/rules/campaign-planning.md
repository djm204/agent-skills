## Channel Selection Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | Questions to Ask |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Audience fit | High | Does the channel reach our target persona where they already are? |
| Intent level | High | Are users on this channel actively seeking solutions or passively browsing? |
| Measurability | Medium | Can we track from impression to pipeline with reasonable accuracy? |
| Cost efficiency | Medium | What is the expected CPL and CPM relative to other channels? |
| Creative fit | Medium | Does this channel suit our content format and brand voice? |
| Scalability | Low-Med | Can we increase spend without diminishing returns? |
| Competitive presence | Low | Are competitors saturating this channel? |

## Media Planning Template

## Media Plan: [Campaign Name]

**Total Budget**: [$X]
**Flight Dates**: [Start] - [End]

### Channel Allocation
| Channel | Budget | % of Total | KPI | Target |
|---------|--------|-----------|-----|--------|
| Paid Search | [$] | [%] | CPA | [$X] |
| LinkedIn Ads | [$] | [%] | CPL | [$X] |
| Content Syndication | [$] | [%] | MQLs | [#] |
| Retargeting | [$] | [%] | Conversion Rate | [%] |
| Email (owned) | [$] | [%] | Pipeline | [$X] |

### Creative Matrix
| Channel | Format | Dimensions | Variants | Copy Length |
|---------|--------|-----------|----------|------------|
| LinkedIn | Sponsored Content | 1200x627 | 3 | 150 chars + headline |
| Google Ads | Responsive Search | Text | 5 headlines, 3 descriptions | 30/90 chars |
| Email | HTML | 600px wide | 2 subject lines | 200-300 words |

### Pacing Schedule
| Week | Spend Target | Focus | Milestone |
|------|-------------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | [$X] | Launch, data collection | Baseline established |
| 2 | [$X] | Optimization | First optimization cycle |
| 3-4 | [$X] | Scale winners | Mid-campaign review |
| 5-6 | [$X] | Final push, retargeting | Close-out |
```

## Budget Management Rules

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| Hold 10% as experiment reserve | Fund tests of new channels or creative without raiding proven spend |
| Reallocate weekly, not daily | Avoid overreacting to daily variance; weekly gives enough signal |
| Set channel floor and ceiling | Minimum ensures enough data to evaluate; maximum prevents over-concentration |
| Track blended CAC, not just CPL | A cheap lead that never converts is more expensive than a pricey one that does |
| Include fully-loaded costs | Headcount, tools, agency fees, and content production all count |

## Creative Best Practices

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|----------|
| Headline | Lead with the customer outcome, not the product feature |
| Body copy | One idea per ad. Short sentences. Active voice. |
| CTA | Specific and value-driven ("See the demo" over "Learn more") |
| Visual | Show the result, not the tool. People and outcomes over screenshots. |
| Social proof | Include numbers, logos, or quotes wherever format allows |
| Urgency | Use genuine scarcity (event dates, cohort limits), never false urgency |

## Common Pitfalls

### Launching Without Tracking

Wrong: Go live with a campaign before confirming that UTM parameters, conversion pixels, and CRM integration are working.

Right: Run a full QA pass on every tracking element before the first dollar is spent. Verify data flows end-to-end from ad click to pipeline record.

### Set-and-Forget Campaigns

Wrong: Launch a campaign and check on it two weeks later.

Right: Monitor daily for the first week. Optimize weekly thereafter. Set automated alerts for pacing, spend, and conversion anomalies.

### Over-Targeting

Wrong: Layer so many targeting criteria that the audience is too small to generate meaningful data or reach.

Right: Start broader than you think necessary. Let the data tell you which segments convert. Narrow based on performance, not assumptions.

### Creative Fatigue Blindness

Wrong: Run the same ad creative for 3 months and wonder why performance is declining.

Right: Refresh creative every 4-6 weeks. Monitor frequency metrics. Have the next round of creative ready before the current round fatigues.
