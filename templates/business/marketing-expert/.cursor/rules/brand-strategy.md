## Positioning Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| Be specific | "Fastest CI/CD for Python teams" beats "Great developer tools" |
| Own a category | Create or redefine a category rather than compete in an existing one |
| Anchor to the customer | Position around what the customer wants, not what you built |
| Differentiate on strength | Choose a dimension where you are genuinely best, not incrementally better |
| Stay consistent | Positioning changes should be rare and deliberate, not reactive |
| Test with customers | If your target customer cannot repeat your positioning, it is not working |

## Brand Voice Framework

| Dimension | Spectrum | Your Position |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Tone | Formal ---- Casual | |
| Personality | Serious ---- Playful | |
| Language | Technical ---- Simple | |
| Perspective | Authoritative ---- Collaborative | |
| Energy | Calm ---- Energetic | |

### Voice Application by Channel

| Channel | Tone Adjustment | Example |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Website homepage | Most polished, aspirational | "Transform how your team ships software" |
| Blog | Educational, approachable | "Here is what we learned running 10K deploys" |
| Social media | Conversational, concise | "CI/CD should not be the bottleneck. We fixed that." |
| Sales emails | Professional, outcome-focused | "Teams like yours reduce deploy time by 60%" |
| Support docs | Clear, helpful, zero jargon | "To configure notifications, go to Settings > Alerts" |
| Error messages | Empathetic, actionable | "Something went wrong. Try refreshing, or contact support." |

## Brand Health Metrics

| Metric | Measurement Method | Frequency |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Aided awareness | Survey: "Which of these brands do you recognize?" | Quarterly |
| Unaided awareness | Survey: "Name brands in [category]" | Quarterly |
| Brand consideration | Survey: "Would you consider [brand] for [use case]?" | Quarterly |
| Net Promoter Score | Post-purchase or periodic survey | Monthly |
| Share of voice | Social listening and media monitoring | Monthly |
| Brand sentiment | Sentiment analysis across channels | Weekly |
| Search volume (branded) | Google Trends, Search Console | Weekly |

## Common Pitfalls

### Positioning by Committee

Wrong: Let every stakeholder add their favorite feature to the positioning statement until it says everything and means nothing.

Right: Assign a single owner for positioning. Gather input widely, but one person decides. Positioning is a choice, and choices require saying no.

### Changing Positioning Too Often

Wrong: Rebrand or reposition every quarter based on the latest competitive move or board feedback.

Right: Commit to positioning for at least 12 months. Give it time to build awareness and recognition. Adjust messaging, not positioning.

### Confusing Brand With Logo

Wrong: Treat brand strategy as a visual identity exercise. Spend all brand budget on logo redesign.

Right: Brand is the sum of every customer interaction: product experience, support quality, content voice, and yes, visual identity. Invest proportionally.
