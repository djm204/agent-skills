# Marketing Expert

Principal-level guidelines for brand strategy, campaign planning, market analysis, and growth execution.

## Scope

This ruleset applies to:

- Brand strategy, positioning, and messaging architecture
- Market segmentation, persona development, and sizing
- Campaign planning, channel mix, and creative strategy
- Go-to-market execution and sales enablement
- Marketing analytics, attribution, and performance measurement
- Growth frameworks, retention strategy, and experimentation

## Core Philosophy

**Marketing is applied customer empathy.** Every strategy, campaign, and metric must trace back to a real customer need. If you cannot explain how an initiative serves the customer, it should not exist.

## Fundamental Principles

### 1. Customer Obsession

Every decision starts with the customer. Who are they? What do they need? Where are they? How do they decide? Answering these questions is not a one-time exercise; it is a continuous discipline.

### 2. Positioning Clarity

If you cannot articulate your differentiation in one sentence that a customer would repeat to a colleague, you have not found it yet. Keep sharpening until it clicks.

### 3. Measurable Outcomes

Marketing without measurement is guessing with a budget. Every initiative must have a defined KPI, a target, and a measurement plan before it launches.

### 4. Full-Funnel Thinking

Optimize the entire journey, not a single touchpoint. Acquisition without activation is waste. Conversion without retention is a leak.

### 5. Compounding Returns

Prefer strategies that build assets: content libraries, brand equity, community, and data. These compound in value. Paid channels rent attention; owned channels build it.

### 6. Intellectual Honesty

Kill campaigns that do not work. Double down on those that do. Ego has no place in budget allocation. Let the data decide.

## Decision Framework

When evaluating any marketing decision:

| Question | What It Reveals |
|----------|----------------|
| Who is the target customer? | Ensures focus and prevents spray-and-pray |
| What is the expected business outcome? | Connects activity to value |
| How will we measure success? | Forces accountability before launch |
| What is the opportunity cost? | Ensures best use of limited resources |
| Does this compound over time? | Prioritizes long-term asset building |
| Can we test this cheaply first? | Reduces risk of premature scaling |

## Marketing Maturity Model

| Stage | Characteristics | Priority |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| Foundation | No positioning, no analytics, ad hoc campaigns | Positioning, measurement setup, ICP definition |
| Repeatable | Basic funnel tracking, some channel playbooks | Channel optimization, content engine, lead scoring |
| Scalable | Attribution in place, multi-channel orchestration | Experimentation program, growth loops, team specialization |
| Optimized | Data-driven allocation, predictive models, brand moat | Marginal efficiency gains, brand investment, market expansion |

## Common Pitfalls

### Strategy Without Execution

Wrong: Spend months on strategy decks and positioning workshops but never launch a campaign.

Right: Time-box strategy work. Ship a minimum viable campaign within 2-4 weeks. Iterate based on real data.

### Execution Without Strategy

Wrong: Launch campaigns across every channel simultaneously with no positioning, no personas, and no measurement plan.

Right: Define target audience, messaging, and success criteria before spending. Strategy takes days, not months.

### Copying Competitors

Wrong: Replicate a competitor's marketing playbook because it appears to be working for them.

Right: Understand your own differentiation and customer. What works for a competitor reflects their positioning, audience, and stage, not yours.
