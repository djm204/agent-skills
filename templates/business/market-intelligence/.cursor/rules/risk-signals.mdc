# Risk Signal Detection

Guidelines for identifying, classifying, and escalating market risk signals.

## Risk Categories

| Category | Examples | Primary Sources |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| Competitive | New entrant, pricing war, feature parity | News, filings, product launches |
| Regulatory | New legislation, enforcement actions | Government sites, legal databases |
| Reputational | Customer backlash, executive scandal | Social media, review platforms |
| Financial | Credit downgrade, liquidity concern | Financial data, credit agencies |
| Geopolitical | Trade restrictions, sanctions, conflict | Wire services, government alerts |
| Technology | Disruption, security breach, obsolescence | Tech press, CVE databases |
| Supply chain | Supplier failure, logistics disruption | Shipping data, supplier news |

## Severity Matrix

```text
              Low Impact    Medium Impact    High Impact    Critical
High Prob.    Monitor       Escalate         Immediate      War Room
Medium Prob.  Log           Monitor          Escalate       Immediate
Low Prob.     Log           Log              Monitor        Escalate
```

## Escalation Protocol

| Severity | Response Time | Notification | Action |
|----------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| Critical | < 30 minutes | Executive team | War room, containment plan |
| High | < 2 hours | Senior leadership | Investigation, mitigation plan |
| Medium | < 24 hours | Department heads | Analysis, options memo |
| Low | Next reporting cycle | Team leads | Log, include in periodic report |

## Early Warning Indicators

Watch for these leading indicators of risk:

- **Executive departures** at competitors or partners (3+ in 6 months)
- **Patent litigation surge** in your technology domain
- **Regulatory comment periods** on rules affecting your industry
- **Credit rating watch** on key suppliers or customers
- **Unusual trading volume** in your sector before announcements
- **Employee sentiment decline** on Glassdoor/Blind for key partners

## Risk Signal Template

```markdown
## Risk Signal: [Title]

**Date Detected**: [Date]
**Severity**: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
**Category**: [Category]
**Source**: [Source with link]

### Description
[What was detected and why it matters]

### Corroboration
- [Supporting source 1]
- [Supporting source 2]

### Potential Impact
[Quantified if possible: revenue at risk, timeline, affected operations]

### Recommended Response
[Specific action with owner and deadline]

### Monitoring
- Reassess by: [Date]
- Escalation trigger: [Condition]
```

## Common Pitfalls

### Crying Wolf

Wrong: Escalate every negative signal as critical.

Right: Use the severity matrix consistently. Reserve "critical" for genuine emergencies.

### Normalizing Risk

Wrong: Accept persistent medium-risk signals as background noise.

Right: Track risk signal duration. A medium risk that persists for 90+ days needs reassessment.
