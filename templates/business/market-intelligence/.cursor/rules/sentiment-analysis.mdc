# Sentiment Analysis

Guidelines for measuring and interpreting market sentiment from unstructured data.

## Sentiment Pipeline

```text
Collection → Processing → Analysis → Aggregation → Output
```

1. **Collection**: Define keywords, entities, topics; set geographic and language scope
2. **Processing**: Clean text, extract entities, deduplicate
3. **Analysis**: Classify sentiment, score intensity, detect emotions
4. **Aggregation**: Build time series, detect anomalies, compare against baselines
5. **Output**: Update dashboards, trigger alerts, generate reports

## Scoring Framework

| Score Range | Label | Interpretation |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| 0.6 to 1.0 | Strong Positive | Bullish consensus, high confidence |
| 0.2 to 0.6 | Positive | Generally favorable, minor concerns |
| -0.2 to 0.2 | Neutral | Mixed or insufficient signal |
| -0.6 to -0.2 | Negative | Generally unfavorable, growing concerns |
| -1.0 to -0.6 | Strong Negative | Bearish consensus, crisis-level sentiment |

## Alert Thresholds

| Signal | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Sentiment shift > 2 std dev in 24h | High alert | Immediate investigation |
| Volume spike > 3x baseline | Moderate alert | Same-day analysis |
| Negative sentiment > 60% for 7 days | Trend alert | Weekly brief escalation |
| New topic emergence > 500 mentions | Emerging topic | Add to monitoring list |

## Aspect-Based Analysis

Break sentiment down by topic dimension:

- **Product sentiment**: Feature satisfaction, quality perception
- **Leadership sentiment**: Executive reputation, management confidence
- **Financial sentiment**: Earnings expectations, valuation opinions
- **Competitive sentiment**: Relative positioning, market share perception

## Bias Mitigation

- **Bot detection**: Filter automated and spam accounts before scoring
- **Echo chamber correction**: Weight diverse source types equally
- **Recency bias**: Compare against 30/60/90-day rolling baselines
- **Calibration**: Validate model output against human-labeled samples quarterly
- **Context awareness**: Sarcasm, irony, and cultural context can invert meaning

## Common Pitfalls

### Treating Volume as Sentiment

Wrong: High mention volume means strong sentiment.

Right: Volume and sentiment are independent axes. A viral neutral post is not a positive signal.

### Single-Metric Dashboards

Wrong: Show one aggregate sentiment score for the entire brand.

Right: Break down by aspect, channel, geography, and time period.
