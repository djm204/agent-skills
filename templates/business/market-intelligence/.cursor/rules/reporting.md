# Intelligence Reporting

Guidelines for structuring, delivering, and measuring the impact of intelligence reports.

## Report Types

| Report | Frequency | Audience | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Flash Alert | As needed | Decision-makers | Critical signals requiring immediate action |
| Daily Brief | Daily | Leadership team | Overnight developments and market snapshot |
| Weekly Strategic | Weekly | Senior leadership | Trend analysis, competitive landscape, risk updates |
| Monthly Deep Dive | Monthly | Cross-functional leads | Thematic analysis on strategic topics |
| Quarterly Outlook | Quarterly | Executive team, board | Forward-looking trend and risk assessment |

## Daily Intelligence Brief Structure

```

## Report Quality Standards

- **Lead with the "so what"**: Start with implications, not data
- **Quantify impact**: Attach revenue, market share, or timeline estimates
- **Include confidence levels**: State how certain you are and why
- **Cite sources**: Every claim links to evidence
- **Recommend action**: Every report ends with specific next steps
- **Keep it scannable**: Use tables, bullets, and bold for key figures

## Distribution Best Practices

- Match report detail to audience seniority (executives want summary, analysts want data)
- Use consistent formatting so readers know where to find what
- Set SLAs for report delivery (daily brief by 8 AM, weekly by Friday noon)
- Track readership and engagement to identify unused reports
- Archive reports for historical pattern analysis

## Measuring Intelligence Impact

| Metric | How to Measure | Target |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Decision influence | Survey decision-makers quarterly | >70% report using intelligence in decisions |
| Signal accuracy | Track prediction vs outcome | >80% confirmed signals |
| Time advantage | Days before mainstream coverage | >5 days average lead time |
| Coverage gaps | Missed events that should have been caught | <2 per quarter |
| Report utilization | Open rates, feedback | >85% readership |

## Common Pitfalls

### Data Dumps Disguised as Reports

Wrong: Send 50 articles with no synthesis or recommendation.

Right: Curate 3-5 key developments with analysis, impact assessment, and recommended actions.

### Static Reporting

Wrong: Same format, same content structure, regardless of what happened.

Right: Adapt report emphasis to current conditions. Lead with what matters most today.
