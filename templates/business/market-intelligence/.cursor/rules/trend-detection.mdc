# Trend Detection

Guidelines for identifying emerging trends through weak signal analysis and pattern recognition.

## Signal Strength Classification

```text
Noise        → One-off mentions, no pattern, low-credibility sources
Weak Signal  → Recurring mentions across 2-3 unrelated sources
Emerging     → Growing volume, multiple credible sources, directional consistency
Confirmed    → Mainstream coverage, data confirmation, measurable impact
Established  → Widely known, priced in, competitive response underway
```

## Detection Indicators

| Indicator | Data Source | Frequency |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Search volume shifts | Google Trends, internal search | Daily |
| Patent filing clusters | USPTO, EPO databases | Weekly |
| Hiring pattern changes | Job posting aggregators | Weekly |
| Investment flow shifts | VC/PE deal databases | Monthly |
| Academic publication clusters | arXiv, PubMed, SSRN | Monthly |
| Regulatory inquiry patterns | Government filings | Weekly |
| Conference topic shifts | Event programs, speaker lists | Quarterly |

## Weak Signal Analysis

A weak signal becomes worth investigating when:

- It appears in **2+ unrelated source types** (e.g., a patent filing AND a job posting cluster)
- It shows **directional consistency** over 3+ data points
- It involves **credible actors** (established companies, reputable researchers)
- It addresses a **known gap** in the market or technology landscape

## Trend Assessment Template

For each detected trend, document:

- **Signal strength**: Weak / Emerging / Confirmed / Established
- **Evidence**: At least 3 independent data points with sources and dates
- **Impact assessment**: Revenue, competitive position, operations, regulatory (High/Med/Low)
- **Time horizon**: When will this materially affect the business?
- **Recommended actions**: Specific steps with owners and deadlines
- **Monitoring plan**: Next review date, key metrics, escalation triggers

## Pattern Recognition Methods

- **Convergence detection**: Multiple independent indicators pointing the same direction
- **Frequency analysis**: Acceleration in mention rate, not just absolute volume
- **Network analysis**: Are thought leaders and early adopters engaging?
- **Cross-industry scanning**: Innovations in adjacent industries that could migrate
- **Absence detection**: What stopped being discussed? Disappearances signal shifts too

## Common Pitfalls

### Chasing Noise

Wrong: Escalate every viral social media post as an "emerging trend."

Right: Require pattern persistence across multiple sources over multiple time periods.

### Ignoring Weak Signals

Wrong: Only pay attention to confirmed, mainstream trends.

Right: Allocate 20% of monitoring capacity to weak signal scanning. The advantage is in early detection.
