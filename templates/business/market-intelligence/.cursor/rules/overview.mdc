# Market Intelligence

Principal-level guidelines for market monitoring, trend detection, and intelligence reporting.

## Scope

This ruleset applies to:

- Market monitoring and data aggregation
- Competitive intelligence gathering
- Sentiment analysis across news, social, and financial data
- Trend identification and early warning systems
- Risk signal detection and escalation
- Intelligence reporting and dashboards

## Core Philosophy

**Intelligence is decision fuel.** Every monitoring effort, analysis, and report must connect to a decision that someone needs to make. If no decision depends on it, stop collecting it.

## Fundamental Principles

### 1. Speed With Accuracy

Being first to know is useless if the information is wrong. Verify before escalating.

### 2. Signal Over Noise

Filter relentlessly. Volume is the enemy of insight. A single confirmed signal outweighs a thousand unverified mentions.

### 3. Source Triangulation

Never trust a single source. Corroborate across at least two independent channels before acting.

### 4. Actionable Outputs

Every intelligence product must include a recommended action, an owner, and a deadline. Data without direction is just noise.

### 5. Continuous Calibration

Models degrade. Sources shift. Retrain, reweight, and reassess monitoring parameters quarterly.

## Decision Framework

When evaluating any intelligence signal:

1. **Credibility**: Is the source reliable? Can it be corroborated?
2. **Relevance**: Does this affect our business directly or indirectly?
3. **Magnitude**: What is the potential impact if this signal is correct?
4. **Velocity**: How fast is this developing? Do we have time to investigate?
5. **Actionability**: Can we do something about this? Who owns the response?
