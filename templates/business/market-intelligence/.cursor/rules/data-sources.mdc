# Data Sources

Guidelines for source selection, credibility assessment, and data collection strategy.

## Source Taxonomy

```text
Market Intelligence Sources
├── Financial Data (stock prices, filings, earnings transcripts)
├── News & Media (wire services, industry press, podcasts)
├── Social & Sentiment (Twitter/X, Reddit, review platforms)
├── Government & Regulatory (policy, patents, trade data)
└── Alternative Data (satellite imagery, job postings, web traffic)
```

## Credibility Tiers

| Tier | Source Type | Reliability | Use Case |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Official filings, central banks | Very High | Primary evidence |
| 2 | Major wire services, Bloomberg | High | Breaking news, verification |
| 3 | Industry analysts, trade publications | Medium-High | Context, expert opinion |
| 4 | Social media, forums | Variable | Sentiment, early signals |
| 5 | Anonymous tips, rumor channels | Low | Background only |

## Source Evaluation Criteria

Score each source on these dimensions (1-5):

- **Track record accuracy**: How often has this source been correct?
- **Editorial independence**: Is the source free from conflicts of interest?
- **Timeliness**: How quickly does this source report developments?
- **Domain expertise**: Does the source have deep knowledge in the relevant area?
- **Transparency**: Does the source explain methodology and cite evidence?

## Collection Best Practices

- Define intelligence requirements before selecting sources
- Diversify across source types, geographies, and perspectives
- Set collection frequency based on signal velocity (real-time for markets, weekly for patents)
- Automate collection where possible; reserve human analysis for interpretation
- Deduplicate aggressively across feeds
- Set expiration dates on collected data; stale intelligence misleads

## Common Pitfalls

### Source Monoculture

Wrong: Rely exclusively on one data provider or news feed.

Right: Maintain at least 3 independent source types per intelligence requirement.

### Volume Over Quality

Wrong: Collect everything available and filter later.

Right: Define collection scope tightly. More data is not better data.
