# Impact Assessment

Guidelines for evaluating the operational, financial, and strategic impact of regulatory changes on business operations.

## Impact Dimensions

Assess every regulatory change across these dimensions:

| Dimension | Key Questions |
|-----------|--------------|
| Operational | Which processes must change? What is the implementation effort? |
| Financial | What are compliance costs? New fees, reporting burdens, or penalty exposure? |
| Technology | Do systems need modification? Are new monitoring tools required? |
| Personnel | Is training required? Are new roles or certifications needed? |
| Strategic | Does this affect market positioning or create barriers to entry? |
| Customer | Will customer experience change? Are new disclosures or consents required? |
| Third-party | Are vendor and partner obligations affected? Do contracts need amendment? |

## Severity Scale

| Level | Definition | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Critical | Fundamental business model change or existential risk | New law prohibits core product offering |
| High | Significant process overhaul or substantial cost | Major data handling requirements across systems |
| Medium | Moderate process adjustments or targeted changes | New reporting for specific product line |
| Low | Minor procedural updates or documentation changes | Updated disclosure language on existing forms |
| Informational | No direct impact, strategic awareness only | Regulation affecting adjacent industry |

## Assessment Process

For each regulatory change:

1. **Identify** the specific provisions that apply to operations
2. **Map** affected business units, processes, and systems
3. **Quantify** compliance costs (technology, personnel, process, legal)
4. **Estimate** timeline for implementation vs. regulatory effective date
5. **Evaluate** risk of non-compliance (penalties, enforcement, reputation)
6. **Determine** whether the change creates competitive advantage for early adopters
7. **Document** findings in standardized impact assessment format

## Cross-Regulation Analysis

Some regulatory changes interact with existing obligations:

- **Conflict detection**: Does the new requirement contradict an existing one in another jurisdiction?
- **Overlap identification**: Can compliance efforts for related regulations be consolidated?
- **Cascade effects**: Does this change trigger obligations under other frameworks (e.g., a privacy change triggers security requirements)?
- **Precedent implications**: Does this enforcement action signal broader regulatory intent?

## Timeline Management

| Phase | Activity | Target |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Detection to Assessment | Complete impact assessment | Within 5 business days of detection |
| Assessment to Plan | Develop implementation roadmap | Within 10 business days of assessment |
| Plan to Implementation | Begin execution | Before 50% of time to effective date consumed |
| Implementation to Validation | Complete testing | At least 30 days before effective date |

## Common Pitfalls

### Under-Scoping Impact

Wrong: Assess impact only on the obviously affected business unit.

Right: Trace the regulation across all operations. Data privacy rules affect marketing, HR, IT, legal, and every unit that handles personal data.

### Ignoring Indirect Costs

Wrong: Estimate only direct compliance costs (technology, legal fees).

Right: Include indirect costs: employee time, opportunity cost, customer friction, vendor renegotiation, and ongoing monitoring.

### Waiting for Final Rules

Wrong: Begin assessment only after the final rule is published.

Right: Start impact assessment during the proposed rule stage. Refine when the final rule drops. This buys months of lead time.
