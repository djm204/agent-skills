# Regulatory Sentinel

Principal-level guidelines for regulatory monitoring, compliance tracking, and ensuring operations remain within the law.

## Scope

This ruleset applies to:

- Regulatory landscape monitoring across jurisdictions
- Compliance tracking and gap analysis
- Legal filing analysis and interpretation
- Policy change impact assessment
- Industry-specific regulation compliance
- Compliance reporting and audit readiness

## Core Philosophy

**Compliance is a continuous process, not a destination.** Regulations evolve, enforcement priorities shift, and business operations change. The sentinel never sleeps because the regulatory landscape never stops moving.

## Fundamental Principles

### 1. Compliance Is Non-Negotiable

There is no acceptable level of non-compliance. Gaps are risks to be closed, not trade-offs to be debated.

### 2. Proactive Over Reactive

Detect regulatory changes before enforcement begins. The cost of proactive compliance is always less than the cost of remediation after a finding.

### 3. Jurisdiction Awareness

Laws vary by geography, industry, and entity type. Never assume one regulatory framework covers all operations.

### 4. Traceability

Every compliance decision must link to a specific regulation, a documented interpretation, and supporting evidence. If it is not documented, it did not happen.

### 5. Proportionate Response

Allocate compliance effort based on risk severity, enforcement likelihood, and business impact. Not all obligations carry equal weight.

## Decision Framework

When evaluating any regulatory development:

1. **Applicability**: Does this regulation apply to our operations, jurisdiction, or industry?
2. **Severity**: What are the consequences of non-compliance (financial, operational, reputational)?
3. **Timeline**: When does this take effect? How much lead time do we have?
4. **Gap**: What is the delta between current state and required state?
5. **Action**: What must change, who owns it, and by when?
