# Risk Classification

Guidelines for classifying, scoring, and prioritizing regulatory compliance risks.

## Risk Matrix

```text
                Low Severity    Medium Severity    High Severity    Critical
High Likelihood   Medium          High               Critical         Critical
Med Likelihood    Low             Medium             High             Critical
Low Likelihood    Low             Low                Medium           High
```

## Severity Criteria

| Factor | Low | Medium | High | Critical |
|--------|-----|--------|------|----------|
| Financial penalty | < $100K | $100K - $1M | $1M - $10M | > $10M |
| Operational disruption | Minimal | Moderate, contained | Significant, multi-unit | Enterprise-wide |
| License/authorization | None | Warning letter | Conditional restriction | Revocation possible |
| Reputational exposure | Internal only | Trade press | Regional media | National/international |
| Customer impact | None | Minor inconvenience | Service degradation | Data breach or harm |
| Enforcement trend | No recent actions | Occasional enforcement | Active campaign | Regulatory sweep |

## Likelihood Assessment

Evaluate likelihood based on:

- **Regulatory activity**: Is the regulator actively enforcing this area?
- **Peer enforcement**: Have similar organizations been penalized recently?
- **Control maturity**: How robust are existing controls?
- **Complexity**: How complex is the requirement? Complexity increases error likelihood.
- **Change velocity**: Has the regulation recently changed? New rules have higher scrutiny.
- **Complaint volume**: Are there external complaints or whistleblower activity in this domain?

## Risk Scoring

Calculate composite risk score:

```text
Composite Score = Severity (1-4) x Likelihood (1-3) x Velocity (1-3)

Severity: Critical=4, High=3, Medium=2, Low=1
Likelihood: High=3, Medium=2, Low=1
Velocity: Immediate=3, Fast=2, Moderate/Slow=1

Score Range: 1-36
  Critical: 24-36 (immediate executive attention)
  High: 12-23 (senior management attention within 48 hours)
  Medium: 4-11 (compliance team manages, report monthly)
  Low: 1-3 (log and review quarterly)
```

## Risk Velocity

| Velocity | Definition | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Immediate | Risk can materialize with no warning | Unannounced regulatory examination |
| Fast | Materializes within days to weeks | Enforcement action following a complaint |
| Moderate | Develops over weeks to months | Proposed rule finalized and effective |
| Slow | Evolves over months to years | Gradual industry-wide regulatory trend |

## Prioritization Process

1. **Catalog** all compliance risks from gap analysis and monitoring
2. **Classify** each risk using the severity and likelihood matrix
3. **Score** with the composite formula including velocity
4. **Rank** risks by composite score, highest first
5. **Allocate** resources to the highest-ranked risks
6. **Review** quarterly or whenever a material regulatory change occurs

## Risk Acceptance

Some residual risk may be accepted when:

- The cost of full compliance dramatically exceeds the risk exposure
- Legal counsel has reviewed and documented the rationale
- Senior leadership has formally approved the acceptance
- The acceptance is time-bound with a defined reassessment date
- Compensating controls partially mitigate the risk

Risk acceptance must never be used for critical-severity obligations.

## Risk Register Template

For each classified risk, maintain:

- **Risk ID and description**
- **Regulation reference**
- **Severity, likelihood, velocity, and composite score**
- **Current controls and their effectiveness**
- **Risk owner** (single accountable person)
- **Remediation plan** if score exceeds threshold
- **Last review date and next review date**

## Common Pitfalls

### Uniform Risk Treatment

Wrong: Apply the same level of effort to all compliance obligations regardless of risk.

Right: Use the risk matrix to differentiate. Critical risks get immediate attention and senior ownership. Low risks get quarterly review.

### Static Risk Scores

Wrong: Score risks once and never update.

Right: Risk scores must be dynamic. Enforcement trends shift, controls degrade, and business operations change. Reassess at least quarterly.

### Ignoring Velocity

Wrong: Focus only on severity and likelihood, ignoring how fast a risk can materialize.

Right: A high-velocity risk needs faster response even at lower severity. An unannounced audit gives zero preparation time.
