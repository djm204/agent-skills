# Compliance Reporting

Guidelines for structuring, delivering, and maintaining compliance reports and audit readiness documentation.

## Report Types

| Report | Frequency | Audience | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Regulatory Change Alert | As needed | Compliance team, affected units | Immediate notification of material changes |
| Compliance Status Dashboard | Weekly | Leadership | Current compliance posture across all obligations |
| Gap Analysis Report | Monthly | Business unit leads | Outstanding gaps and remediation progress |
| Regulatory Horizon Report | Quarterly | Executive team | Upcoming changes and strategic impact |
| Audit Readiness Assessment | Quarterly | Audit committee | Preparedness for regulatory examination |
| Annual Compliance Report | Annual | Board of directors | Program effectiveness and risk posture |

## Compliance Dashboard Structure

Every dashboard must include:

- **Overall compliance score** as a percentage
- **Status by domain** (privacy, financial, health/safety, employment, etc.)
- **Critical items requiring attention** with owners and deadlines
- **Upcoming regulatory changes** with effective dates and readiness status
- **Remediation progress** for open gaps

## Report Quality Standards

- **Lead with risk**: Start with the most critical compliance exposures, not routine metrics
- **Quantify exposure**: Attach potential penalty amounts, enforcement likelihood, and business impact
- **State confidence level**: Indicate how certain the compliance assessment is and note any gaps in evidence
- **Cite regulation**: Every compliance claim references a specific regulatory provision
- **Include actions**: Every report identifies what needs to happen next, who owns it, and by when
- **Keep it scannable**: Use tables, status indicators, and clear headings for executive audiences

## Audit Readiness

Maintain continuous readiness through:

- **Documentation**: All policies current, procedures aligned, evidence retained
- **Controls**: Tested within the assessment period, failures documented and remediated
- **Governance**: Committee minutes documented, escalation paths current, roles assigned
- **Response plan**: Examination response team identified, document request procedures rehearsed

## Regulatory Change Alert Format

```markdown
## Regulatory Change Alert: [Title]

**Date**: [Date]
**Severity**: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
**Regulation**: [Citation]
**Effective Date**: [Date]

### What Changed
[2-3 sentences in plain language]

### Who Is Affected
[Business units, processes, or products impacted]

### Required Action
[Specific steps, owners, and deadlines]

### Deadline for Response
[Date by which action must be completed]
```

## Distribution Best Practices

- Match detail level to audience: executives want summary and risk, compliance teams want specifics
- Use consistent formatting so readers know where to find critical information
- Set delivery SLAs: alerts within 24 hours, dashboards by Monday morning, quarterly reports by month-end
- Track whether reports are read and acted upon; unused reports should be eliminated or restructured
- Archive all reports for audit trail and historical trend analysis

## Measuring Compliance Program Effectiveness

| Metric | How to Measure | Target |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Gap closure rate | Gaps remediated within target timeline | > 90% |
| Regulatory change response time | Days from detection to assessment complete | < 5 business days |
| Audit findings | Number of findings per examination | Decreasing trend |
| Training completion | Percentage of required training completed on time | > 95% |
| Policy currency | Percentage of policies reviewed within schedule | 100% |

## Common Pitfalls

### Reporting Without Insight

Wrong: Produce a 50-page compliance report that restates what the regulation says.

Right: Focus on compliance posture, gaps, risks, and required actions. The reader needs to know what to do, not what the law says.

### Static Reporting

Wrong: Use the same report template regardless of current risk environment.

Right: Adapt emphasis to current conditions. If a major regulatory change is imminent, lead with that. If an audit is approaching, lead with readiness.
