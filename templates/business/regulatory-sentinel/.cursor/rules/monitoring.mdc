# Regulatory Monitoring

Guidelines for continuous scanning of regulatory sources, detecting changes, and maintaining situational awareness across jurisdictions.

## Source Categories

```text
Regulatory Intelligence Sources
├── Primary Legal Sources (registers, statutes, court opinions)
├── Regulatory Agency Communications (enforcement, guidance, bulletins)
├── Industry Bodies (SRO rules, standards, professional requirements)
├── Legislative Activity (bills, hearings, lobbying disclosures)
└── Enforcement Intelligence (penalties, consent decrees, exam schedules)
```

## Source Reliability Tiers

| Tier | Source Type | Authority Level |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | Official gazettes, enacted statutes | Definitive |
| 2 | Regulatory agency final rules | Very High |
| 3 | Proposed rules, comment periods | High |
| 4 | Agency guidance, staff bulletins | Medium-High |
| 5 | Industry analysis, legal commentary | Medium |
| 6 | Political signals, rumored policy shifts | Low - speculative |

## Monitoring Schedule

| Source | Frequency | Priority |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Federal/national registers | Daily | Critical |
| Enforcement actions against peers | Daily | High |
| Regulatory agency announcements | Daily | High |
| Legislative bill tracking | Weekly | Medium |
| Guidance documents and FAQs | Weekly | Medium |
| International regulatory developments | Weekly | Medium |
| Industry standards updates | Monthly | Low-Medium |
| Regulatory comment period deadlines | Weekly calendar check | High |

## Horizon Scanning

Look beyond current regulations to anticipate future requirements:

- **Proposed legislation**: Track bills through committee, floor votes, and conference
- **Regulatory agendas**: Review semi-annual regulatory agendas published by agencies
- **Enforcement trends**: Increasing enforcement in a domain signals stricter rules ahead
- **International precedent**: Regulations adopted in one jurisdiction often spread to others
- **Industry incidents**: Major breaches, failures, or scandals trigger regulatory responses
- **Political platforms**: Incoming administrations signal regulatory priorities

## Change Detection Signals

| Signal | Strength | Response |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Final rule published in official register | Definitive | Begin implementation assessment immediately |
| Proposed rule with comment period | Strong | Assess impact, prepare comment if warranted |
| Agency enforcement action against peer | Strong | Self-assess against the cited violations |
| Legislative bill introduced | Moderate | Add to tracking list, assess if advances |
| Agency leadership speech on priorities | Moderate | Note as directional indicator |
| Industry group advocacy position | Weak | Monitor for legislative uptake |
| Media speculation on regulatory intent | Weak | Log, do not act until corroborated |

## Alert Escalation

| Alert Level | Trigger | Response Time | Notification |
|-------------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Critical | Final rule affecting core operations | < 24 hours | Executive team, legal, affected business units |
| High | Enforcement action in our sector or proposed rule with direct impact | < 48 hours | Compliance team, affected business units |
| Medium | Guidance update or standard change | Within 1 week | Compliance team |
| Low | Informational development, adjacent industry | Next reporting cycle | Include in periodic report |

## Common Pitfalls

### Alert Fatigue

Wrong: Send every regulatory development as a high-priority alert.

Right: Classify rigorously. Reserve high-priority alerts for changes that require action. Bundle informational items into periodic digests.

### Jurisdictional Blind Spots

Wrong: Monitor only federal/national regulations and miss state, local, or international requirements.

Right: Map all jurisdictions where the organization operates and establish monitoring for each level of government.

### Monitoring Without Action

Wrong: Collect regulatory changes in a database that nobody reviews.

Right: Every detected change must flow into the assessment pipeline within the defined response time. Monitoring without triage is waste.
