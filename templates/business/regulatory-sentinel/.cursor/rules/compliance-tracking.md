# Compliance Tracking

Guidelines for maintaining a comprehensive compliance obligation register, conducting gap analysis, and managing remediation.

## Compliance Obligation Register

Every regulatory obligation must be cataloged with:

- **Obligation ID**: Unique identifier for tracking
- **Regulation reference**: Specific statute, rule, and section
- **Jurisdiction**: Federal, state, country, or international body
- **Business units affected**: Which parts of the organization this touches
- **Compliance status**: Compliant, Partially Compliant, Non-Compliant, Not Assessed
- **Control owner**: Person accountable for compliance
- **Evidence artifacts**: Policies, procedures, test results demonstrating compliance
- **Assessment dates**: Last assessed and next scheduled assessment

## Gap Analysis Process

1. **Inventory** all applicable regulations and map them to business processes
2. **Assess** current controls against each regulatory requirement
3. **Identify** where controls are missing, insufficient, or untested
4. **Prioritize** gaps by risk severity, enforcement likelihood, and remediation cost
5. **Remediate** with assigned owners, firm deadlines, and tracked progress
6. **Validate** that remediated controls actually work through testing
7. **Monitor** continuously for sustained compliance

## Status Definitions

| Status | Meaning | Required Action |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Compliant | Controls in place, evidence documented, tested within period | Maintain and re-test on schedule |
| Partially Compliant | Some controls exist but gaps remain | Remediation plan with deadline required |
| Non-Compliant | No adequate controls for this obligation | Immediate remediation and risk acceptance decision |
| Not Assessed | Obligation identified but not yet evaluated | Schedule assessment within 30 days |

## Evidence Standards

Evidence must be:

- **Specific**: Tied to a particular obligation and control
- **Current**: Dated within the assessment period
- **Complete**: Covers all aspects of the regulatory requirement
- **Authentic**: Generated by the control itself, not reconstructed after the fact
- **Retained**: Stored per the organization's record retention policy

## Remediation Tracking

For every identified gap:

- Set a deadline aligned with risk severity (critical: 30 days, high: 60, medium: 90, low: next quarter)
- Assign a single accountable owner, not a committee
- Track progress weekly for critical and high gaps
- Require validation testing before closing the gap
- Document the remediation for audit trail purposes

## Common Pitfalls

### Stale Registers

Wrong: Build the obligation register once and never update it.

Right: Review the register quarterly. Add new obligations as regulations change. Remove obligations that no longer apply.

### Compliance Without Evidence

Wrong: Mark an obligation as "compliant" based on verbal assurance.

Right: Require documented evidence for every compliance assertion. No evidence, no compliance status.
