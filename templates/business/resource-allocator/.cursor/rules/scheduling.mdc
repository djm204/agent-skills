# Personnel Scheduling and Shift Optimization

Guidelines for building and maintaining staff schedules that balance coverage, fairness, and human endurance.

## Scheduling Layers

```text
Strategic (months) → Tactical (weeks) → Operational (hours/real-time)
```

- **Strategic**: Headcount planning, hiring pipeline, training schedules, leave allocation
- **Tactical**: Shift roster generation, on-call rotations, overtime pre-authorization
- **Operational**: No-show backfill, demand-driven redeployment, crisis staffing activation

## Hard Constraints

These must never be violated by the scheduler:

| Constraint | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| Maximum shift length (e.g., 12 hours) | Fatigue degrades decision-making and safety |
| Minimum rest between shifts (e.g., 10 hours) | Recovery time prevents compounding errors |
| Weekly hour limits (e.g., 60 hours) | Regulatory compliance and burnout prevention |
| Minimum staffing ratios per shift | Regulatory and safety floor |
| Certification match for role | Only qualified personnel in certified positions |

## Soft Constraints

Optimize toward these; violate with documented tradeoff:

| Constraint | Target | Tracking |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Shift preference honoring | > 80% of requests | Monthly satisfaction survey |
| Seniority balance across shifts | Even distribution | Standard deviation of seniority per shift |
| Overtime equity | Spread equally among willing staff | Variance in overtime hours per person |
| Team continuity | Same team composition > 70% of shifts | Team stability index |
| Commute fairness | No systematic site assignment by distance | Assignment distribution audit |

## Fatigue Risk Model

```text
Green  → Normal operations, adequate rest, standard shifts
Yellow → Extended shift or short turnaround; monitor closely
Orange → Consecutive extended shifts; restrict safety-critical tasks
Red    → Approaching regulatory limits; mandatory stand-down
```

Track fatigue score per individual. Inputs: hours worked in last 24h, 48h, 7 days; time since last full rest period; shift timing (night shifts accumulate fatigue faster).

## Schedule Quality Metrics

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Coverage ratio | 100% of minimum staffing | Unfilled positions create safety gaps |
| Overtime percentage | < 8% of total hours | High overtime signals understaffing |
| Vacancy fill time | < 4 hours for critical roles | Prolonged gaps increase risk |
| Schedule stability | < 15% post-publication changes | Frequent changes erode trust and morale |
| Preference satisfaction | > 80% | Retention and engagement driver |
| Fatigue incidents | Zero tolerance | Any fatigue-related error triggers review |

## Backfill Protocol

When an absence is detected:

1. Check internal float pool availability
2. Offer overtime to qualified on-site staff (respect fatigue limits)
3. Activate on-call personnel
4. Request cross-site transfer via coordination platform
5. Engage agency or contract staff (pre-approved roster)
6. If unfilled: escalate to operations manager, document gap and risk

## Common Pitfalls

### Treating People as Interchangeable

Wrong: Any warm body fills any slot.

Right: Match certifications, experience level, and team dynamics. A pediatric nurse is not an ICU nurse. A probationary firefighter is not a hazmat technician.

### Ignoring Schedule Fatigue in Crisis

Wrong: During a surge, schedule 16-hour shifts for a week straight.

Right: Even in crisis, rotate rest periods. Fatigued responders make errors that compound the crisis. Build relief rotations into every crisis staffing plan.

### Optimizing Only for Cost

Wrong: Minimize total labor cost as the sole objective.

Right: Multi-objective optimization: cost, coverage, fatigue risk, equity, and employee satisfaction. Cheap schedules with high turnover are expensive in the long run.
