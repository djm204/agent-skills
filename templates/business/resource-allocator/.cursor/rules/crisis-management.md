# Crisis Escalation and Triage

Guidelines for managing resource allocation when demand exceeds normal capacity.

## Crisis Levels

| Level | Name | Demand vs Forecast | Key Action |
|-------|------|-------------------|------------|
| 1 | Normal | Within forecast | Standard allocation |
| 2 | Elevated | 20-50% above | Activate reserves, pre-position assets |
| 3 | Surge | 50-100% above | Cancel non-essential, request mutual aid |
| 4 | Major Incident | Exceeds capacity | Crisis command center, triage protocols |
| 5 | Catastrophic | System overwhelmed | Regional/national coordination, crisis standards |

## Escalation Authority

Each level transition requires explicit authorization:

- **Level 1 to 2**: Shift supervisor
- **Level 2 to 3**: Operations manager
- **Level 3 to 4**: Incident commander or director
- **Level 4 to 5**: Executive leadership with emergency management

De-escalation follows the same chain in reverse. Never skip levels in either direction without documenting the rationale.

## Triage Prioritization

| Priority | Label | Criteria | Allocation Rule |
|----------|-------|----------|----------------|
| P1 | Immediate | Life-threatening, time-critical | First allocation, best-matched resources |
| P2 | Urgent | Serious but stable for 1-4 hours | Second allocation, may queue briefly |
| P3 | Delayed | Important but not time-sensitive | Queued, served as capacity allows |
| P4 | Minor | Low severity, can self-manage temporarily | Deferred to lower-acuity resources |
| P5 | Expectant | Needs exceed available resources | Comfort measures only (crisis standards) |

Triage is reassessed continuously. A P3 patient whose condition deteriorates becomes P2 or P1.

## Crisis Resource Allocation Rules

1. **Suspend non-critical operations**: Elective procedures, training exercises, routine maintenance
2. **Consolidate demand**: Direct low-acuity cases to alternate sites or telehealth
3. **Expand capacity**: Open overflow areas, convert spaces, deploy field resources
4. **Mutual aid**: Request resources from neighboring sites per pre-agreed protocols
5. **Ration deliberately**: When supply is exhausted, apply triage matrix transparently

## Communication During Crisis

### Situation Report Cadence

| Crisis Level | Report Frequency | Distribution |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Level 2 | Every 4 hours | Operations team |
| Level 3 | Every 2 hours | Operations + leadership |
| Level 4 | Every hour | All stakeholders |
| Level 5 | Every 30 minutes | All stakeholders + external agencies |

### Required Elements per Report

- Current crisis level and trend direction
- Resource status by type (available, deployed, inbound, gap)
- Actions taken since last report
- Immediate needs with priority
- Next decision point or update time

## Post-Crisis Review

Every Level 3+ event triggers a structured after-action review within 7 days:

1. **Timeline reconstruction**: What happened and when
2. **Decision audit**: What was decided, by whom, with what information
3. **Resource effectiveness**: Were the right resources deployed to the right places
4. **Communication review**: Did information flow to the right people in time
5. **Improvement actions**: Specific changes with owners and deadlines

## Common Pitfalls

### Delayed Escalation

Wrong: Wait until resources are exhausted before escalating. Hope the surge passes.

Right: Escalate early based on trajectory, not just current state. It is easier to de-escalate than to recover from behind.

### Abandoning the System

Wrong: During crisis, bypass all allocation protocols and dispatch ad hoc.

Right: The system exists precisely for crisis. Follow triage protocols. Ad hoc decisions under stress are systematically worse than structured ones.

### Forgetting De-Escalation

Wrong: Maintain crisis posture long after demand normalizes. Staff burn out in sustained high alert.

Right: Define explicit de-escalation criteria. When conditions meet thresholds, step down deliberately and communicate the stand-down.
