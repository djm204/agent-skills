# Trend Reporting

Guidelines for communicating trend forecasts, visualizing data, and delivering actionable insights.

## Report Types

| Report | Frequency | Audience | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Trend Flash | As needed | Design/product leads | Newly detected emerging signal |
| Seasonal Forecast | Bi-annual | Leadership, merchandising | Forward-looking 12-18 month outlook |
| Trend Tracker | Monthly | Cross-functional teams | Status updates on monitored trends |
| Retrospective | Quarterly | Strategy team | Accuracy review and model calibration |
| Annual Outlook | Yearly | Executive team, board | Macro-level cultural and aesthetic direction |

## Forecast Report Structure

```markdown
## Trend Forecast: [Trend Name]

**Date**: [Date]
**Analyst**: [Name]
**Lifecycle Stage**: Emergence / Growth / Peak / Decline
**Confidence**: High / Medium / Low

### Summary
[2-3 sentences: What is the trend, where is it heading, and why it matters]

### Evidence
| Signal Source | Data Point | Date | Strength |
|--------------|-----------|------|----------|
| [Source] | [Observation] | [Date] | [Strong/Moderate/Weak] |

### Visual References
[Mood boards, color palettes, silhouette sketches, reference images]

### Market Impact
| Segment | Impact | Timing |
|---------|--------|--------|
| [Segment] | [High/Med/Low] | [Season/Year] |

### Recommended Actions
1. [Action with owner and timeline]
2. [Action with owner and timeline]

### Risk Factors
- [What could accelerate or stall this trend]
```

## Visualization Standards

- **Color forecasts**: Show Pantone/hex swatches with context imagery
- **Trend trajectories**: Plot lifecycle curves with current position marked
- **Heat maps**: Geographic adoption patterns across markets
- **Comparison boards**: Side-by-side of emerging vs. declining aesthetics
- **Timeline views**: When to design, produce, and launch relative to trend peak

## Accuracy Tracking

| Metric | How to Measure | Target |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Directional accuracy | Did the trend move as predicted? | > 75% |
| Timing accuracy | Did it peak within predicted window? | +/- 1 season |
| Magnitude accuracy | Was the market impact as estimated? | +/- 25% |
| Adoption path | Did it follow predicted segment sequence? | > 60% match |

## Distribution Best Practices

- Lead with visual evidence - trend audiences think in images, not spreadsheets
- Tailor depth to audience: executives get summary + recommendation; designers get full mood boards
- Include "so what" for every trend: what should we start, stop, or continue?
- Archive all forecasts for retrospective accuracy analysis
- Set review dates: revisit every forecast at predicted inflection points

## Common Pitfalls

### Beautiful Reports, No Action

Wrong: Produce stunning trend books that sit on a shelf.

Right: Every forecast ends with specific product, design, or strategy recommendations with owners.

### Reporting Without Confidence Levels

Wrong: Present all trends with equal conviction.

Right: Clearly label confidence (high/medium/low) and evidence strength. Decision-makers need to know what's a strong bet vs. a speculative signal.
