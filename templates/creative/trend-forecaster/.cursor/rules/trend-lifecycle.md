# Trend Lifecycle

Guidelines for classifying trends by lifecycle stage, predicting trajectory, and advising stakeholders on timing.

## Lifecycle Stages

Every trend passes through six stages, though duration varies:

### Stage 1: Incubation (24-36 months before mainstream)

Visible only in art, subculture, and experimental design. No commercial presence. Found in galleries, zines, underground communities, and art school degree shows. Forecaster action: document, catalog, and monitor for acceleration.

### Stage 2: Emergence (12-24 months before mainstream)

Appears in runway collections, design-forward retail, and curated trade shows. Early adopters express interest but mass retail has not engaged. Forecaster action: name the trend, frame the narrative, and assess commercial potential.

### Stage 3: Acceleration (6-12 months before mainstream)

Cross-domain validation appears. Influencer adoption moves from niche to mid-tier. Trend-forward retailers begin stocking. Social media velocity increases measurably. Forecaster action: quantify the trajectory, project the timeline, and advise product development teams.

### Stage 4: Peak (0-6 months, mainstream presence)

Mass market adoption and ubiquitous visibility. Maximum commercial opportunity but saturation is increasing. Mass retailers, mainstream media, and broad consumer awareness all confirm. Forecaster action: identify saturation indicators and forecast decline onset.

### Stage 5: Plateau (6-18 months post-peak)

Stable presence but innovation within the trend stalls. Discounting begins. Derivative and diluted variations proliferate. Consumer enthusiasm decreases even as commercial presence remains high. Forecaster action: advise transition strategy and identify successor signals.

### Stage 6: Decline and Archive (18-36 months post-peak)

Active avoidance by trend-conscious consumers. Clearance and phase-out at retail. Negative sentiment, parody, and backlash content emerge. Forecaster action: archive the full lifecycle for cyclical return analysis.

## Stage Assessment Criteria

| Indicator | Incubation | Emergence | Acceleration | Peak | Plateau | Decline |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|------|---------|---------|
| Source diversity | 1-2 sources | 3-5 sources | 5-10 sources | Broad | Broad but stale | Narrowing |
| Commercial presence | None | Niche retail | Trend-forward retail | Mass retail | Mass + discount | Clearance only |
| Consumer segment | Innovators only | Early adopters | Early majority entering | Early + late majority | Late majority dominant | Laggards only |
| Media coverage | None | Niche press | Feature articles | Ubiquitous | Fatigue articles | Retrospectives |
| Social velocity | Undetectable | Low, niche communities | Accelerating | High but plateauing | Stable or declining | Declining sharply |

## Velocity Indicators

Acceleration signals: Month-over-month search increase above 20%, exponential hashtag growth, new SKU introductions across price tiers, tier migration in influencer adoption (micro to macro to celebrity), feature placement in mainstream media.

Deceleration signals: Plateauing search interest, declining engagement despite stable mention volume, increasing markdown rates, influencer abandonment, "trend fatigue" articles, parody content emergence.

## Strategic Timing Guidance

| Stakeholder Type | Optimal Entry | Optimal Exit |
|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| Luxury and designer | Incubation to Emergence | Acceleration (before mass adoption dilutes exclusivity) |
| Premium and contemporary | Emergence to Acceleration | Peak (capture maximum value before discounting) |
| Mid-market | Acceleration to early Peak | Plateau (ride the mainstream wave, exit before decline) |
| Mass market and value | Peak | Decline (serve laggard demand at reduced margin) |

## Common Pitfalls

### Stage Skipping

Wrong: Assume a trend can jump from incubation to peak without passing through emergence and acceleration.

Right: Recognize that every stage serves a function in building consumer readiness. Digital amplification can compress timelines but does not eliminate stages.

### Ignoring the Decline Advisory

Wrong: Focus forecasting exclusively on what is emerging and never advise on what is fading.

Right: Clients need exit timing as urgently as entry timing. Every forecast should pair "what is coming" with "what is peaking" and "what is fading."
