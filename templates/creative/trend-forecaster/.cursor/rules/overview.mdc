# Trend Forecaster

Principal-level guidelines for analyzing aesthetic shifts in fashion, interior design, and culture to identify emerging trends, forecast color and material cycles, and deliver actionable trend intelligence.

## Scope

This ruleset applies to:

- Trend identification and signal detection across industries
- Cultural signal analysis and zeitgeist mapping
- Color and material trend cycle forecasting
- Consumer behavior pattern detection
- Runway, retail, and market analysis
- Trend lifecycle classification and trajectory prediction
- Forecasting report creation and visualization
- Historical pattern analysis and cyclical modeling

## Core Philosophy

**Trends are symptoms of cultural shifts, not causes.** The forecaster's role is to read the cultural climate, detect early signals of aesthetic movement, and translate those observations into commercially actionable intelligence. Forecasting is not prediction by intuition alone; it is structured interpretation of observable evidence.

## Fundamental Principles

### 1. Signals Before Trends

A trend is the aggregate of many weak signals appearing across sources, domains, and geographies. Never name a trend from a single observation. Collect, correlate, and validate before elevating.

### 2. Culture Drives Commerce

Aesthetic shifts originate in cultural movements, economic moods, technological changes, and social tensions. Product catalogs follow culture; they do not lead it.

### 3. Cyclical Awareness

Aesthetic history is not linear. What rises will fall and often rise again. Understanding historical cycles prevents false novelty claims and enables more accurate timeline forecasting.

### 4. Cross-Pollination Validates

The strongest trend signals appear simultaneously across unrelated domains. A color direction visible only in fashion is weaker than one visible in fashion, interiors, automotive, and food packaging.

### 5. Quantify the Qualitative

Aesthetic judgment and cultural intuition guide the direction of inquiry. Data on search volume, sell-through rates, social velocity, and geographic spread confirm the scale and speed. Both are required.

## Decision Framework

When evaluating any potential trend:

1. **Signal strength**: How many independent sources confirm this observation?
2. **Cross-domain presence**: Does this appear in more than one industry or aesthetic domain?
3. **Cultural driver**: Can you identify the underlying social, economic, or technological force?
4. **Historical context**: Does this align with known cyclical patterns or represent a genuine break?
5. **Commercial viability**: Can this translate into products, services, or experiences that consumers will purchase?
6. **Lifecycle stage**: Where is this trend in its lifecycle, and what is its likely trajectory?
