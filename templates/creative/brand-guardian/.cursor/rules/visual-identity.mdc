# Visual Identity

Guidelines for verifying and enforcing visual brand standards across all content and channels.

## Visual Identity Checklist

Every piece of visual content must pass these checks:

### Logo Usage

- Correct version selected (primary, secondary, icon-only) for the context
- Minimum clear space maintained around the logo
- Minimum size requirements met for legibility
- No unauthorized modifications (stretching, recoloring, adding effects)
- Approved color variations only (full color, monochrome, reversed)
- Correct placement and alignment per layout templates

### Color Palette

- Primary colors within hex/RGB tolerance (no eyeballed approximations)
- Secondary and accent colors used in correct proportions
- Color ratios follow brand-defined proportions (e.g., 60/30/10 rule)
- Accessible contrast ratios maintained (WCAG AA minimum: 4.5:1 for text)
- No unapproved colors introduced without brand team sign-off

### Typography

- Approved typefaces only, no substitutions without fallback approval
- Correct weight and style hierarchy (heading, subheading, body, caption)
- Minimum size requirements met per channel
- Line height and letter spacing follow specifications
- Web and email fallback fonts specified and tested

### Imagery

- Photography style matches guidelines (lighting, composition, color grading)
- Illustration style consistent with brand visual language
- Image quality meets minimum resolution for output medium
- Representation and diversity in imagery align with brand values
- All assets properly licensed or owned

## Deviation Severity

| Severity | Examples | Required Action |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| Critical | Wrong logo, competitor colors, unlicensed images | Block publication immediately |
| High | Incorrect logo spacing, wrong typeface, poor contrast | Return for correction before publishing |
| Medium | Slightly off-brand color shade, suboptimal image crop | Flag for next revision cycle |
| Low | Minor spacing inconsistency, acceptable font substitution | Log for style guide discussion |

## Automated Checks

Where possible, automate visual compliance:

- Color extraction and hex value validation against approved palette
- Logo detection and clear space measurement
- Font identification in design files
- Contrast ratio calculation for text over backgrounds
- Image resolution and aspect ratio verification

## Asset Management

- Maintain a single-source-of-truth digital asset library
- Version all brand assets with clear naming conventions
- Remove outdated assets promptly to prevent accidental use
- Restrict upload permissions to brand team members
- Provide self-serve access to approved templates and assets for creators

## Common Pitfalls

### Template Proliferation

Wrong: Allow every team to create their own templates from scratch.

Right: Provide centrally managed, pre-approved templates that creators can populate with content.

### Platform Compression Blindness

Wrong: Approve visual assets at source resolution but never verify how they render after platform compression and resizing.

Right: Test visual assets in their final published form on each target platform before approval.
