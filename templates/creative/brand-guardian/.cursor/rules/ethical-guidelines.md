# Ethical Guidelines

Guidelines for ensuring all brand content meets ethical standards for truthfulness, inclusivity, privacy, and social responsibility.

## Ethical Review Areas

### Truthfulness

- No misleading claims or deceptive implications
- Statistics cited with full context and original source
- Testimonials genuine, representative, and properly consented
- Before/after comparisons fair, documented, and typical
- Competitive claims substantiated and legally defensible
- No fine-print contradictions that undermine headline claims

### Inclusivity

- Visual representation across demographics (age, ethnicity, gender, ability, body type)
- Language free from bias, stereotypes, and assumptions
- Content accessible to people with disabilities (alt text, captions, contrast, structure)
- Culturally appropriate across all target markets
- Gender-neutral language used where possible
- No tokenism or performative representation

### Privacy

- No personal data exposed without explicit consent
- User-generated content properly credited and permission obtained
- Data collection purposes transparent and minimal
- Opt-out options clearly presented and easy to execute
- Children's privacy protections strictly enforced (COPPA, GDPR-K)
- No dark patterns in consent flows

### Environmental Claims

- Sustainability claims verifiable with third-party evidence
- No greenwashing or exaggeration of environmental impact
- Certifications current, legitimate, and properly displayed
- Carbon offset and neutrality claims transparent in methodology

### Social Responsibility

- No exploitation of fear, shame, insecurity, or FOMO as primary tactics
- Mental health impact of messaging considered
- Community impact assessed for campaigns with social dimensions
- Labor and supply chain claims verified and current

## Sensitivity Review Triggers

Content requires elevated review when it:

- References current events, tragedies, or social movements
- Targets or features children or vulnerable populations
- Makes health, safety, or financial claims
- Addresses social, political, or religious topics
- Uses humor, satire, or irony that could be misinterpreted
- Features user-generated content or real people
- Enters new geographic or cultural markets
- Coincides with culturally significant dates or events

## Escalation Protocol

| Severity | Response Time | Action |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Critical (legal risk, public harm) | Immediate | Pull content, notify legal, executive briefing |
| High (misleading, exclusionary) | < 4 hours | Hold publication, brand team review |
| Medium (tone-deaf, minor bias) | < 24 hours | Revise before next scheduled publish |
| Low (best practice improvement) | Next review cycle | Note for training and guideline updates |

## Regulatory Awareness

Stay current with:

- FTC advertising and endorsement guidelines
- Industry-specific regulations (finance, health, alcohol, gambling)
- Data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, and local equivalents)
- Accessibility requirements (ADA, EAA, WCAG)
- Platform-specific advertising policies (Meta, Google, TikTok)

## Common Pitfalls

### Ethics as Afterthought

Wrong: Complete creative production, then ask "does this have any ethical issues?" at the final review gate.

Right: Integrate ethical considerations at the briefing stage. Prevent problems rather than catching them.

### Performative Inclusion

Wrong: Feature diverse imagery in advertising while internal practices and product design remain exclusionary.

Right: Ensure external representation reflects genuine internal commitment. Audiences detect inauthenticity.

### Assuming Universal Context

Wrong: Approve content for global distribution based on a single cultural perspective.

Right: Route content through local market reviewers when entering new geographies or addressing culturally specific topics.
