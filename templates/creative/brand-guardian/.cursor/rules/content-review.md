# Content Review

Guidelines for structured content review workflows, approval gates, and quality assurance processes.

## Review Tier System

Content review effort must match content risk and reach:

| Tier | Risk Level | Content Types | Review Process |
|------|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Tier 1 | Low | Internal comms, social replies, routine emails | Creator self-check against checklist |
| Tier 2 | Medium | Blog posts, social campaigns, email campaigns | One brand team member review |
| Tier 3 | High | Advertising, press releases, website updates | Brand manager + legal if needed |
| Tier 4 | Critical | Crisis comms, partnerships, major launches | Brand lead + executive + legal |

## Review Checklist Categories

Every content review evaluates five areas:

### 1. Voice and Tone

- Matches defined brand voice attributes
- Tone appropriate for channel and context
- Vocabulary aligns with approved word lists
- No prohibited words or phrases used
- Reading level appropriate for target audience

### 2. Visual Identity

- Logo usage correct for context
- Color palette compliant with brand standards
- Typography follows guidelines
- Imagery on-brand and properly licensed
- Layout follows approved templates

### 3. Messaging

- Core value proposition present and clear
- Key messages aligned with current campaign priorities
- Call to action consistent with brand standards
- No conflicting claims compared to other active channels
- Factual claims verified and sourced

### 4. Compliance

- Legal disclaimers included where required
- Regulatory requirements met for industry and geography
- Privacy policy referenced when collecting data
- Accessibility standards met (alt text, contrast, structure)
- Cultural sensitivity reviewed for target markets

### 5. Technical Quality

- Grammar, spelling, and punctuation correct
- Links functional and pointing to correct destinations
- Metadata complete (titles, descriptions, tags)
- Format correct for target platform specifications
- Tracking parameters properly appended

## Turnaround SLAs

| Tier | Maximum Turnaround | Escalation Contact |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Tier 1 | Immediate (self-serve) | N/A |
| Tier 2 | 4 business hours | Brand manager |
| Tier 3 | 1 business day | Brand director |
| Tier 4 | 2 business days | CMO or executive sponsor |

## Feedback Standards

Review feedback must be:

- **Specific**: Reference exact text or visual elements, not vague impressions
- **Actionable**: Explain what needs to change and why, with examples when possible
- **Prioritized**: Distinguish between must-fix issues and nice-to-have improvements
- **Constructive**: Frame corrections as brand alignment, not personal preference

## Common Pitfalls

### Review Theater

Wrong: Rubber-stamp content without meaningful evaluation to meet SLAs.

Right: If review cannot be thorough within the SLA, escalate to adjust timeline rather than skip checks.

### Scope Creep in Reviews

Wrong: Use brand review as an opportunity to rewrite creative direction or challenge strategy.

Right: Brand review evaluates compliance with established standards. Strategic disagreements belong in a separate forum.

### Missing the Forest for the Trees

Wrong: Approve content that passes every individual checklist item but feels fundamentally off-brand as a whole.

Right: Include a holistic "gut check" question: Would a loyal customer immediately recognize this as coming from our brand?
