# Brand Voice

Guidelines for defining, documenting, and enforcing a consistent brand voice across all content.

## Voice Architecture

A brand voice has three layers:

1. **Core Identity**: The unchanging personality traits, values, and mission that define who the brand is
2. **Voice Attributes**: Specific, measurable characteristics (e.g., confident, warm, direct) with examples and counter-examples
3. **Tone Ranges**: The acceptable spectrum of formality, emotion, and authority that shifts by channel and context

## Defining Voice Attributes

Every voice attribute must include:

- A clear one-sentence definition
- Three or more "sounds like" examples
- Three or more "does not sound like" counter-examples
- Channel intensity ratings showing how strongly the attribute appears in each medium

Attributes are typically grouped as primary (always present), secondary (context-dependent), and anti-attributes (never present).

## Voice Consistency Scoring

| Criterion | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Vocabulary alignment | 20% |
| Sentence structure match | 15% |
| Tone appropriateness | 20% |
| Personality expression | 15% |
| Audience awareness | 15% |
| Channel adaptation | 15% |

Score interpretation:

- 4.5-5.0: Exemplary, use as reference content
- 3.5-4.4: On-brand, approved for publication
- 2.5-3.4: Needs revision, specific adjustments required
- 1.5-2.4: Off-brand, significant rewrite needed
- Below 1.5: Reject, does not represent the brand

## Tone Spectrum

Tone is the variable expression of a fixed voice. Map each content type along these spectrums:

- Formal to Casual
- Serious to Playful
- Authoritative to Approachable
- Technical to Accessible

Each content type (social post, press release, support email) should have a defined position on each spectrum.

## Word List Governance

Maintain four lists:

- **Preferred terms**: Always use when describing brand concepts
- **Acceptable alternatives**: Permitted but not preferred
- **Prohibited terms**: Never use in brand communications
- **Inclusive language**: Preferred over exclusionary alternatives

Review and update word lists quarterly. Track new terminology emerging from product, marketing, and customer usage.

## Common Pitfalls

### Voice as Script

Wrong: Give creators exact sentences to copy and paste for every scenario.

Right: Define the personality, provide examples, and trust trained creators to express it authentically.

### Confusing Voice and Tone

Wrong: Treat voice and tone as the same thing. Apply identical tone to a celebration post and a crisis statement.

Right: Voice is constant personality. Tone is the mood that shifts with context. The brand always sounds like itself but adjusts its emotional register.

### Ignoring Internal Voice

Wrong: Enforce brand voice in marketing but allow internal communications, recruiting, and partner materials to speak however they please.

Right: Brand voice applies everywhere the brand name appears. Internal culture documents, job postings, and partner materials all carry brand equity.
