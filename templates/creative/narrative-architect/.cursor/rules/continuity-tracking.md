# Continuity Tracking

Guidelines for maintaining lore consistency, managing character continuity, and detecting contradictions across all narrative content.

## Lore Dependency Graph

Every canonical fact exists in relationship to other facts. Dependencies fall into five types:

| Type | Meaning | Breaking Consequence |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| Causal | A caused B | Invalidating A makes B nonsensical |
| Referential | A mentions B | Changing B requires updating A |
| Constraining | A limits what B can be | Expanding A may violate B |
| Temporal | A happens before B | Moving A may break event sequence |
| Thematic | A and B share narrative purpose | Changing A's meaning may undermine B |

Before modifying any canonical fact, trace its dependencies to predict which downstream content will be affected.

## Character Continuity

### Knowledge State Tracking

Characters must only act on information they possess. For every scene:

- Verify the character was present when information was revealed, or was told by someone who was
- Check that the character has not forgotten or been misled about the information
- Confirm the character's emotional state and biases would lead them to act on this knowledge in the way depicted

### Ability and Power Tracking

- Record every skill, power, or ability with the scene where it was first demonstrated
- Track progression with in-universe justification for each increase
- Enforce hard ceilings on power levels unless formally amended
- Log injuries, losses, and limitations with the same rigor as gains

### Relationship State

- Track the current status of every significant relationship
- Record the event that most recently changed each relationship
- Verify that characters interact in ways consistent with their current relationship status

## Contradiction Severity

| Severity | Definition | Pre-Release Action | Post-Release Action |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Critical | Breaks a fundamental universe rule | Block release, mandatory rewrite | Emergency patch or errata |
| Major | Contradicts a widely known fact | Rewrite before release | Retcon with documentation |
| Moderate | Contradicts a documented minor detail | Fix if time allows | Fix in future reprints or patches |
| Minor | Inconsistency most will not notice | Log for future fix | Log for future fix |
| Cosmetic | Stylistic variation only | Standardize going forward | Standardize going forward |

## Pre-Publication Validation

Every piece of content must pass a lore validation check before approval:

1. All referenced locations verified against world bible
2. Character knowledge states confirmed against knowledge matrix
3. Magic or technology usage validated against system rules
4. Historical references verified against chronology spine
5. Character descriptions checked against canonical profiles
6. New elements documented and evaluated for canon tier
7. Dependencies mapped for all new facts introduced

## Community-Reported Issues

Fan communities are an effective contradiction detection system:

- Triage reported issues weekly
- Classify by severity using the standard scale
- Acknowledge valid catches through appropriate channels
- Integrate confirmed issues into the contradiction resolution pipeline

## Common Pitfalls

### Assumption of Recall

Wrong: Assume the team remembers details from content published years ago.

Right: Search the story bible for every reference before writing. Trust documentation over memory.

### Parallel Development Drift

Wrong: Allow two teams to write content set in the same period without coordinating.

Right: Synchronize character states, world states, and event sequences between parallel projects at the start of each development cycle.
