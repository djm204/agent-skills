# World-Building

Guidelines for constructing, documenting, and maintaining internally consistent narrative universes.

## World Bible Organization

Every narrative universe requires a structured world bible organized into searchable, cross-referenced volumes:

- **Cosmology and Physics**: Fundamental rules, magic or technology systems, constraints
- **Geography**: Maps, climate, ecology, notable locations, travel distances
- **History**: Eras, wars, turning points, lost history
- **Cultures**: Nations, languages, religions, social structures, customs
- **Characters**: Profiles, relationship maps, arc tracking
- **Technology and Magic**: System rules, artifacts, power scaling, interactions
- **Meta-Narrative**: Themes, tone, genre boundaries, franchise identity

## Documentation Standards

Every world element must include:

1. **Precise definition** as established in canon, not as imagined or intended
2. **Source citation** identifying where the element was first established
3. **Canon tier** indicating the authority level of the source
4. **Dependencies** listing what this element relies on and what relies on it
5. **Established facts table** with specific details, sources, and dates
6. **Open questions** documenting deliberately ambiguous aspects

## Coverage Requirements

| Coverage Level | Meaning | Writer Guidance |
|---------------|---------|-----------------|
| 90-100% | Production-ready | Safe to reference without consultation |
| 70-89% | Functional with gaps | Use with awareness of undocumented areas |
| 50-69% | Risky | Consult narrative architect before referencing |
| Below 50% | Underdeveloped | Likely to produce contradictions if used |

## System Rules Documentation

Magic systems, technology frameworks, and physics rules require special rigor:

- State what the system can do with explicit examples
- State what the system cannot do with explicit boundaries
- Document edge cases and known limitations
- Record interaction rules between multiple systems
- Track power scaling with hard upper limits
- Require narrative architect approval before expanding system capabilities

## Geography and Distance

- All named locations must be placed on canonical maps
- Travel distances between major locations must be calculated and recorded
- Travel times must account for terrain, technology, and character capabilities
- Writers must verify distances before writing travel sequences

## Common Pitfalls

### Undocumented Expansion

Wrong: Introduce a new region, species, or magic rule in passing without adding it to the world bible.

Right: Every new world element gets a full documentation entry before or immediately after the content is approved.

### Inconsistent Physics

Wrong: Allow the rules of magic or technology to flex based on what the current story needs.

Right: System rules are constraints. If a story needs something the rules do not allow, change the story or formally amend the rules through the approval process.

### Geography by Convenience

Wrong: Place locations wherever is convenient for the current plot without checking existing maps.

Right: Consult the canonical geography before establishing any spatial relationship between locations.
