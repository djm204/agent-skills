# Collaboration

Guidelines for governing collaborative writing, coordinating across media teams, and managing the content submission pipeline.

## Writer Onboarding

New writers progress through four phases:

1. **Orientation** (Week 1): Story bible access, canon tier system training, review process walkthrough, key contacts
2. **Guided Writing** (Weeks 2-4): First submission reviewed with detailed lore feedback, cross-reference tools demonstrated, character voice calibrated
3. **Independent Writing** (Week 5+): Standard review process, reduced oversight as track record builds
4. **Senior Contributor**: May review others' lore compliance, propose story bible amendments, mentor new writers

## Collaborative Writing Rules

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| Major character deaths require narrative architect approval | Permanent downstream consequences across all media |
| New magic or tech rules require approval | System rules constrain all future stories |
| New named locations must be checked against geography | Prevents duplicate or conflicting place names |
| Dialogue must respect character knowledge states | Prevents characters knowing things they should not |
| Historical references must be verified against timeline | Prevents temporal contradictions |
| New species, factions, or cultures require documentation first | Prevents under-documented elements from proliferating |

## Content Submission Pipeline

Every piece of narrative content follows this workflow:

1. **Draft submission**: Writer submits with self-check completed, new lore elements flagged, dependencies listed
2. **Lore review**: Narrative architect checks canon compliance, flags contradictions with specific references, evaluates new elements
3. **Revision**: Writer addresses required changes, resubmits for verification
4. **Approval**: Content marked lore-approved, new canonical facts queued for story bible, cross-media notifications sent
5. **Post-publication**: Story bible updated, dependency graph updated, timeline updated, community feedback monitored

## Cross-Media Coordination

When multiple media are active simultaneously:

- Establish shared canon layer that all media must respect
- Define media-specific permissions for tone, pacing, and detail adaptation
- Set synchronization points for character status alignment
- Coordinate release schedules to prevent cross-media spoilers
- Designate the narrative architect as final authority on shared-layer disputes

### Media Authority Matrix

- Any team may propose new canonical elements
- The narrative architect approves or rejects proposals based on consistency impact
- Character deaths and system rule changes require IP owner approval in addition to narrative architect
- Non-canon side stories may be created independently by respective team leads

## Conflict Resolution Between Writers

| Conflict Type | Resolution |
|--------------|-----------|
| Parallel writers establish contradictory facts | Narrative architect determines canonical version |
| Writer disagrees with a lore constraint | Writer proposes amendment through story bible process |
| Multiple writers need the same character simultaneously | Narrative architect coordinates scheduling and state transitions |
| Writer wants to retcon another writer's content | Full retcon protocol followed; original writer consulted |

## Communication Standards

- Lore review feedback must be specific, citing exact story bible references
- Feedback must be actionable, explaining what to change and why
- Feedback must distinguish between required fixes and suggestions
- Turnaround for lore review should not exceed one week for standard submissions
- Urgent submissions (release-blocking) receive 48-hour turnaround

## Common Pitfalls

### Siloed Development

Wrong: Allow teams working on different media or installments to develop in isolation without regular synchronization.

Right: Schedule cross-team canon alignment meetings at the start and midpoint of every development cycle.

### Authority Without Documentation

Wrong: Make verbal canonical decisions in meetings without recording them in the story bible.

Right: Every canonical decision, no matter how small, must be documented within one week of being made.

### Feedback Without References

Wrong: Reject content with vague notes like "this does not feel right" or "check the lore."

Right: Every lore objection must cite the specific story bible entry, installment, and passage that the submitted content contradicts.
