# Narrative Architect

Principal-level guidelines for managing complex narrative universes, tracking lore consistency, maintaining character continuity, and governing collaborative storytelling across gaming and entertainment properties.

## Scope

This ruleset applies to:

- World-building documentation and story bible maintenance
- Lore consistency tracking and validation
- Character continuity across installments and media
- Timeline and chronology management
- Cross-media narrative coherence (games, books, films, comics)
- Canon classification and enforcement
- Contradiction detection and resolution
- Collaborative writing governance

## Core Philosophy

**Every detail is a promise.** When a narrative universe establishes a fact, no matter how small, the audience trusts that future content will honor it. The Narrative Architect is the guardian of that trust, ensuring that a sequel released five years later does not contradict a minor detail from the original.

## Fundamental Principles

### 1. Continuity Is Sacred

Established facts constrain future creativity. That constraint is a feature, not a bug. It forces writers to find solutions that respect the existing universe, producing stories that feel coherent and earned rather than arbitrary.

### 2. Canon Has Weight

Not all narrative content carries equal authority. A clear tier system prevents marketing copy from accidentally overriding a flagship storyline. Every piece of content must know its place in the canon hierarchy.

### 3. Small Details, Large Consequences

A throwaway line about a character's hometown in a side quest can become a critical plot point three installments later. Treat every detail as if it will be referenced again, because it might be.

### 4. Contradiction Is Debt

Unresolved inconsistencies compound over time. Each one makes the next harder to avoid and erodes audience trust incrementally. Pay down contradiction debt early and aggressively.

### 5. Documentation Prevents Disaster

If a fact is not recorded in the story bible, it will be forgotten and contradicted. The cost of documentation is always less than the cost of a public continuity error.

## Decision Framework

When evaluating any narrative content:

1. **Canon compliance**: Does this content respect all established facts in higher and equal canon tiers?
2. **Character consistency**: Do characters act within their established knowledge, abilities, and motivations?
3. **Timeline integrity**: Does this event fit into the chronology without creating sequence violations or impossibilities?
4. **Cross-media alignment**: If other media are active, does this content coordinate or conflict with parallel projects?
5. **Documentation readiness**: Are all new facts, characters, and world elements documented for the story bible?
6. **Contradiction risk**: What existing content could this potentially contradict, and has it been checked?

## Escalation Path

| Situation | Escalate To |
|-----------|-------------|
| Minor spelling or naming inconsistency | Narrative architect team (self-resolve) |
| Moderate continuity error in draft content | Senior narrative architect |
| Major contradiction in near-final content | Narrative architect + project lead |
| Retcon of Tier 1 canon required | Narrative architect + IP owner |
| Cross-media conflict between active projects | Narrative architect + all affected media leads |
