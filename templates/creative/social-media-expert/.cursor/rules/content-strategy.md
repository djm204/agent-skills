# Content Strategy

Guidelines for planning, creating, and optimizing social media content through pillar frameworks, editorial calendars, and storytelling best practices.

## Content Pillar Development

Every social media account should organize content around 3-5 recurring strategic pillars:

| Pillar Type | Purpose | Content Examples | Mix Target |
|-------------|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| Educational / Value | Demonstrate expertise, provide actionable takeaways | How-tos, tips, tutorials, frameworks, explainers | 30-40% |
| Industry / Commentary | Position within broader conversations, show relevance | Trend analysis, news reactions, predictions, opinions | 20-25% |
| Community / Behind-the-Scenes | Build human connection, show authenticity | Team spotlights, process reveals, day-in-the-life, Q&As | 15-20% |
| Social Proof / Results | Validate claims with evidence, build trust | Testimonials, case studies, UGC, milestones, before/after | 10-15% |
| Entertainment / Culture | Drive shareability and reach, show personality | Memes, trends, humor, relatable moments, challenges | 10-15% |

## Editorial Calendar Structure

```text
Editorial Calendar Layers
├── Quarterly Theme
│   ├── Aligned with business goals and seasonal relevance
│   ├── Defines the overarching narrative for 12 weeks
│   └── Example: "Q1 - New Year Momentum" or "Q3 - Back to Business"
├── Monthly Focus
│   ├── Specific topic area within quarterly theme
│   ├── Campaign launches, product milestones, industry events
│   └── Allows cohesive storytelling across 4-5 weeks
├── Weekly Content Mix
│   ├── Specific posts planned by platform, pillar, and format
│   ├── 70% planned content, 30% reactive/flexible slots
│   └── Each week balanced across content pillars
└── Daily Execution
    ├── Post creation, review, and scheduling
    ├── Community engagement and response
    └── Real-time trend evaluation for flexible slots
```

## Content Format Selection

| Format | Strengths | Best Platforms | Production Effort | Shelf Life |
|--------|----------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Short video (< 60s) | Highest reach, algorithm-favored | TikTok, Reels, Shorts | Medium | 2-7 days |
| Carousel / slideshow | High saves, educational depth | Instagram, LinkedIn | Medium | 1-4 weeks |
| Long-form video (5+ min) | Deep authority, search-driven | YouTube | High | Months to years |
| Text post | Fast production, thought leadership | LinkedIn, X | Low | 24-72 hours |
| Thread / multi-post | Storytelling depth, high engagement | X, Threads | Low-Medium | 12-48 hours |
| Live stream | Real-time engagement, community building | IG Live, TikTok Live, YouTube Live | Low (prep) / High (execution) | Session + replay |
| Stories (ephemeral) | Daily touchpoint, casual engagement | Instagram, Facebook | Low | 24 hours |
| User-generated content | Authenticity, social proof, low cost | All platforms | Low (curation) | Varies |
| Infographic / static image | Quick value, shareable data | Instagram, LinkedIn, X | Medium | 1-2 weeks |
| Polls / interactive | Engagement boost, audience insight | X, IG Stories, LinkedIn | Low | 24-48 hours |

## Hook Writing Guidelines

The first line of a caption or the first 3 seconds of a video determine whether your content is consumed or skipped.

| Hook Category | Pattern | When to Use |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| Contrarian | "Stop doing [common practice]. Here's why." | Challenging assumptions, thought leadership |
| Curiosity gap | "This one change [impressive result]." | Results-driven content, case studies |
| Direct value | "[Number] [things] every [audience] needs to know" | Educational content, lists, how-tos |
| Story open | Start mid-conflict or with unexpected moment | Narrative content, personal stories |
| Question | "Why do [audience] still [common mistake]?" | Discussion starters, community engagement |
| Social proof | "After [credential/experience], here's what works." | Authority building, expert advice |
| Pattern interrupt | Visual or textual surprise that breaks expectations | Video content, Reels, TikTok |

## Storytelling Framework for Social

```text
Social Story Arc (Micro-Narratives)
├── The Setup (Hook)
│   ├── Grab attention in first line or first 3 seconds
│   ├── Create an open loop the audience needs to close
│   └── Make it about THEM, not about you
├── The Struggle (Tension)
│   ├── Present the problem, challenge, or conflict
│   ├── Make the audience feel the pain or curiosity
│   └── Build anticipation for the resolution
├── The Shift (Insight)
│   ├── Deliver the unexpected insight, solution, or lesson
│   ├── This is the "aha moment" that earns saves and shares
│   └── Be specific: vague advice does not resonate
├── The Proof (Evidence)
│   ├── Support the insight with data, example, or result
│   ├── Screenshots, testimonials, numbers add credibility
│   └── Show, do not just tell
└── The Ask (CTA)
    ├── One clear, single action for the audience
    ├── Follow, save, comment, share, click, or try
    └── Make the CTA relevant to the value just delivered
```

## Content Production Workflow

| Stage | Activities | Owner | Timeline |
|-------|-----------|-------|----------|
| Ideation | Brainstorm topics from pillars, trends, audience questions, and analytics | Strategist | Ongoing / weekly brainstorm |
| Briefing | Write content brief: platform, format, hook, key message, CTA, assets needed | Strategist | 7 days before publish |
| Creation | Write copy, shoot/edit video, design graphics | Creator / Designer | 5 days before publish |
| Review | Brand voice check, fact verification, legal/compliance if needed | Reviewer | 3 days before publish |
| Scheduling | Upload to scheduling tool, set publish time, add UTM links | Coordinator | 1 day before publish |
| Publishing | Post goes live, monitor initial engagement | Coordinator | Publish day |
| Engagement | Respond to comments, share to stories, engage in first hour | Community Manager | First 2 hours post-publish |
| Analysis | Track performance metrics, note learnings | Analyst | 48-72 hours post-publish |

## Content Batching Strategy

| Approach | Description | Best For |
|----------|------------|---------|
| Theme batching | Create all content for one pillar in a single session | Maintaining voice consistency within a pillar |
| Format batching | Shoot all videos in one session, write all captions in another | Efficient use of equipment, setup, and creative mode |
| Platform batching | Create all content for one platform at a time | Maintaining platform-native quality |
| Repurpose batching | Take completed content and adapt for all secondary platforms | Maximizing content ROI with minimal effort |

## Common Pitfalls

### Content Without Strategy

Wrong: Create content based on what feels good today with no pillar framework, no calendar, and no connection to business objectives.

Right: Every piece of content should trace back to a content pillar, which traces back to a business goal. If you cannot explain why this post exists, do not publish it.

### Perfection Over Consistency

Wrong: Delay posting because the graphic is not perfect, the caption needs one more revision, or the video needs professional editing.

Right: Done is better than perfect on social media. Audience attention is perishable. A good post published today beats a perfect post published next week. Reserve polish for hero content; embrace raw for daily content.

### Ignoring the CTA

Wrong: Create valuable content that engages the audience but never asks them to take the next step (follow, save, click, comment, share).

Right: Every post should have one clear call to action. Not every CTA is a sales pitch. "Save this for later," "Tag someone who needs this," and "Drop a question in the comments" are all CTAs that drive engagement and algorithm signals.
