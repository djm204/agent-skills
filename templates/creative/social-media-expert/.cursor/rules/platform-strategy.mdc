# Platform Strategy

Guidelines for selecting, optimizing, and managing presence across social media platforms with algorithm-aware, platform-native approaches.

## Platform Selection Criteria

Before establishing a presence on any platform, evaluate:

| Criterion | Question to Answer | Weight |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Audience presence | Is our target audience active and growing on this platform? | 30% |
| Content format fit | Can we consistently produce content in the formats this platform rewards? | 25% |
| Business goal alignment | Does this platform support our primary objective (awareness, leads, sales, community)? | 20% |
| Resource requirement | Do we have the team, tools, and budget to maintain quality presence? | 15% |
| Competitive landscape | Is there whitespace or is the platform oversaturated in our category? | 10% |

## Platform-Specific Optimization

### Instagram

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|--------------|
| Reels | 7-15 seconds optimal; trending audio within 48h of trend; text overlays for silent viewing |
| Carousels | 5-10 slides; educational or storytelling; first slide is the hook, last slide is the CTA |
| Stories | Daily minimum; use polls, questions, sliders for engagement; link stickers for traffic |
| Feed posts | High-quality imagery; cohesive grid aesthetic; detailed captions with value |
| Algorithm priority | Reels > Carousels > Single image; Saves and Shares weighted highest |

### TikTok

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|--------------|
| Video length | 15-45 seconds for discovery; 1-3 minutes for depth; watch-through rate is king |
| Trends | Participate within 24-48h of trend emergence; add unique brand angle |
| Hooks | First 1-2 seconds must stop the scroll; text hooks, visual hooks, or audio hooks |
| Posting volume | 1-3 per day during growth phase; quality over quantity once established |
| Algorithm priority | Completion rate > Shares > Comments > Likes; content shown to non-followers first |

### LinkedIn

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|--------------|
| Text posts | Personal stories with professional insight; line breaks for readability; 1,200-1,500 characters |
| Carousels (PDF) | Slide-by-slide value; 8-12 slides; actionable frameworks or step-by-step guides |
| Video | Subtitled, vertical or square; 30-90 seconds; professional but authentic |
| Articles | Long-form thought leadership; SEO value; establishes deep authority |
| Algorithm priority | Dwell time > Comments > Reactions; first hour engagement critical; avoid external links in post |

### X (Twitter)

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|--------------|
| Posts | Sharp, opinionated, concise; one idea per post; provoke discussion |
| Threads | 5-12 posts; number them; each post should stand alone; pin the thread |
| Engagement | Reply to others in your niche daily; quote tweets with added value |
| Spaces | Host weekly on niche topic; invite industry guests; repurpose audio clips |
| Algorithm priority | Reply engagement > Repost > Like; conversation velocity in first 30 minutes |

### YouTube

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|--------------|
| Titles | Curiosity-driven, keyword-rich; under 60 characters; avoid clickbait that underdelivers |
| Thumbnails | High contrast, readable text, expressive faces; test 3 variations |
| Retention | Hook in first 30 seconds; pattern interrupt every 60-90 seconds; deliver on title promise |
| Shorts | Vertical, 15-45 seconds; repurpose long-form highlights; loop-friendly endings |
| Algorithm priority | Click-through rate + average view duration = primary ranking signals |

## Cross-Platform Content Repurposing

```text
Content Repurposing Flow
├── Original Long-Form (YouTube video or blog)
│   ├── Cut 3-5 short clips for TikTok and Reels
│   ├── Extract key insight for LinkedIn text post
│   ├── Pull quote for X post with link
│   ├── Create carousel summarizing key points for Instagram
│   └── Record behind-the-scenes of creation for Stories
├── Original Short-Form (TikTok or Reel)
│   ├── Repost to Shorts (remove watermark, re-upload natively)
│   ├── Expand into LinkedIn text post with deeper analysis
│   ├── Use as teaser for longer YouTube video
│   └── Screenshot best comment for X engagement post
└── Original Text (LinkedIn post or X thread)
    ├── Convert to Instagram carousel with visual design
    ├── Record yourself reading it for TikTok/Reels talking head
    ├── Expand into YouTube script for deeper video
    └── Repurpose as email newsletter content
```

## Platform Health Monitoring

| Metric | Healthy Range | Warning Sign | Action If Warning |
|--------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| Engagement rate | Platform average +50% | Declining 3 weeks straight | Audit content quality and format mix |
| Follower growth rate | 2-5% monthly (organic) | Negative growth or sudden spikes | Check for bot follows or content issues |
| Reach per post | Stable or growing | Declining without posting changes | Algorithm shift; test new formats |
| Profile visits to follow ratio | 10-30% conversion | Below 5% | Optimize bio, pinned content, grid |
| Story completion rate (IG) | 70%+ on each slide | Below 50% on slide 2+ | Shorten stories, improve hooks |

## Common Pitfalls

### Platform FOMO

Wrong: Launch on every new platform the week it is announced, spreading resources thin and producing mediocre content everywhere.

Right: Monitor emerging platforms with a test account. Invest meaningfully only when audience data confirms your target market is adopting and the format suits your content capabilities.

### Ignoring Algorithm Changes

Wrong: Continue posting the same format and expecting the same results after a major algorithm update.

Right: Follow platform creator blogs and industry analysts. When algorithms shift (e.g., Instagram prioritizing Reels, LinkedIn deprioritizing external links), adapt strategy within one week.

### Treating All Platforms as Equal

Wrong: Allocate equal time, budget, and resources across all platforms regardless of where your audience is and which platform drives results.

Right: Audit performance quarterly. Double down on platforms delivering ROI. Maintain minimal presence on secondary platforms. Drop platforms that consistently underperform after 6 months of effort.
