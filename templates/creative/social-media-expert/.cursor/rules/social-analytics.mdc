# Social Analytics

Guidelines for measuring social media performance, building reports, conducting A/B tests, and translating data into strategic decisions.

## Metrics Hierarchy

Not all metrics are created equal. Organize them by business relevance:

| Tier | Metric Category | Key Metrics | Why It Matters |
|------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| Tier 1: Business Impact | Revenue and conversions | Social-attributed revenue, cost per acquisition, lead volume | Directly proves ROI of social investment |
| Tier 2: Behavioral | Traffic and actions | Link clicks, landing page visits, email signups, app installs | Shows audience moving from social to business outcomes |
| Tier 3: Engagement | Interaction quality | Engagement rate, save rate, share rate, comment depth | Indicates content resonance and community health |
| Tier 4: Awareness | Reach and exposure | Impressions, reach, video views, follower growth | Shows brand visibility and audience expansion |

## Platform-Specific Key Metrics

| Metric | Instagram | TikTok | LinkedIn | X | YouTube |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|---|---------|
| Primary engagement | Saves + Shares | Completion rate + Shares | Dwell time + Comments | Replies + Reposts | Watch time + Subscribers |
| Content quality signal | Save rate | Full video views | Comment length | Quote tweets with context | Average view duration |
| Discovery signal | Reel reach to non-followers | For You page views | Impressions from network | Impression sources | Click-through rate |
| Community signal | DM volume + Story replies | Follower-to-like ratio | Connection requests | Follower engagement rate | Community post engagement |
| Conversion signal | Link clicks (bio + Stories) | TikTok Shop clicks | Website clicks | Link clicks | Description link clicks |

## A/B Testing Protocol

| Test Element | Variables | Sample Size | Duration | Success Metric |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| Post timing | 2-3 different publish times | 10+ posts per time slot | 3-4 weeks | Average engagement rate by time |
| Hook style | 2 hook approaches on same topic | 5+ posts per approach | 2-3 weeks | First-3-second retention or engagement rate |
| Format | Carousel vs. single vs. video on same topic | 5+ posts per format | 3-4 weeks | Reach and engagement rate |
| Caption length | Short (< 50 words) vs. long (200+ words) | 10+ posts per length | 4 weeks | Engagement rate and saves |
| CTA phrasing | Different CTAs on similar content | 10+ posts per CTA | 4 weeks | Action completion rate |
| Hashtag sets | 3 different hashtag groups | 10+ posts per set | 4 weeks | Reach from hashtags |
| Thumbnail / first slide | 2-3 visual variations | 3+ per variation | 2 weeks | Click-through rate |

### Testing Discipline

```text
A/B Testing Rules
├── Test one variable at a time
│   └── Changing multiple variables makes results uninterpretable
├── Define success metric before launching
│   └── Choosing the metric after seeing results introduces bias
├── Set minimum sample size before starting
│   └── Do not call a winner after 3 posts
├── Run tests for sufficient duration
│   └── At least 2 full weeks to account for day-of-week variance
├── Document every test and result
│   └── Build institutional knowledge; avoid re-running the same tests
└── Act on results
    └── A test that does not change strategy is a wasted test
```

## Competitive Benchmarking

| Benchmark Element | What to Track | Source | Frequency |
|-------------------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Follower count and growth | Competitor audience size and growth trajectory | Public profiles + tracking tools | Monthly |
| Engagement rate | Average engagement relative to follower count | Public metrics + estimation tools | Monthly |
| Content mix | What formats and topics competitors prioritize | Manual content audit | Quarterly |
| Posting frequency | How often competitors post per platform | Manual tracking or tools | Monthly |
| Top-performing content | What types of posts get highest engagement | Public profile analysis | Monthly |
| Share of voice | Relative brand mention volume in your category | Social listening tools | Monthly |
| Paid activity | Ad Library review for active campaigns and creative | Meta Ad Library, TikTok Creative Center | Monthly |
| New platform adoption | Where competitors are experimenting | Platform monitoring | Ongoing |

## Attribution Models

| Model | How It Works | Strengths | Limitations |
|-------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Last-touch | Credits the final social interaction before conversion | Simple, easy to implement | Ignores awareness and consideration touchpoints |
| First-touch | Credits the first social interaction | Values discovery and top-of-funnel | Ignores nurturing and decision-stage content |
| Linear | Equal credit to all social touchpoints | Acknowledges full journey | Over-credits low-impact touches |
| Time-decay | More credit to interactions closer to conversion | Balances journey and recency | Complex to set up |
| Incrementality | Measures lift from social vs. holdout group | Most accurate for proving true impact | Requires scale and testing infrastructure |

## Common Pitfalls

### Reporting Without Insight

Wrong: Send a weekly report that lists numbers (impressions: 50K, engagement rate: 3.2%, followers: +127) with no context, comparison, or recommendation.

Right: Every metric should answer "so what?" Compare to targets, previous periods, and benchmarks. End every report section with a recommended action based on the data.

### Optimizing for the Wrong Metric

Wrong: Optimize all content for maximum reach (impressions) when the business goal is lead generation. Celebrate going viral on a post that drove zero clicks.

Right: Align content optimization with the metric that maps to your business objective. If the goal is leads, optimize for click-through rate and conversion rate, not impressions.

### Ignoring Qualitative Data

Wrong: Make all decisions based on quantitative metrics while ignoring what people are actually saying in comments, DMs, and mentions.

Right: Quantitative data tells you what is happening. Qualitative data (comment themes, DM questions, sentiment) tells you why. Read comments. Read DMs. Let audience language inform content strategy.
