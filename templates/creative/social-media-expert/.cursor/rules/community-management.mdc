# Community Management

Guidelines for managing social media communities, moderating conversations, monitoring sentiment, and handling crisis communication with speed and professionalism.

## Community Engagement Philosophy

Community management is the practice of turning followers into advocates. It requires consistent presence, genuine interaction, and clear boundaries.

```text
Community Maturity Model
├── Stage 1: Audience (Passive)
│   ├── People see your content but do not interact
│   ├── Focus: Create content worth stopping for
│   └── Metric: Impressions and reach
├── Stage 2: Followers (Interested)
│   ├── People follow and occasionally engage
│   ├── Focus: Respond to every interaction; invite conversation
│   └── Metric: Follower growth rate and engagement rate
├── Stage 3: Community (Active)
│   ├── People engage regularly and with each other
│   ├── Focus: Facilitate member-to-member conversation; recognize regulars
│   └── Metric: Comments per post, DM volume, repeat engagers
├── Stage 4: Advocates (Invested)
│   ├── People create content about you and recommend you unprompted
│   ├── Focus: Amplify advocates, reward loyalty, co-create
│   └── Metric: UGC volume, brand mentions, referral traffic
└── Stage 5: Ambassadors (Aligned)
    ├── People identify with and defend the brand publicly
    ├── Focus: Formalize relationships, exclusive access, feedback loops
    └── Metric: Ambassador program KPIs, sentiment during crises
```

## Common Pitfalls

### Deleting All Negative Comments

Wrong: Delete every negative comment to maintain a perfect-looking comment section, making the brand appear curated and inauthentic.

Right: Leave constructive criticism visible and respond with empathy and solutions. Only delete comments that violate community guidelines (hate speech, spam, threats). A brand that handles criticism well earns more trust than one that hides it.

### Template Responses for Everything

Wrong: Copy-paste the same generic response to every comment. "Thanks for your feedback! We appreciate your support."

Right: Personalize responses. Reference the specific content of their comment. Use their name when visible. Genuine responses take more time but build real community connections.

### Ignoring DMs

Wrong: Treat DMs as low-priority or ignore them entirely because they are not publicly visible.

Right: DMs often contain your most engaged followers, potential customers, and partnership opportunities. Prioritize DM response as highly as public comment response. Set up organized workflows for DM management.
