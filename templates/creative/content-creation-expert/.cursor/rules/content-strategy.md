# Content Strategy

Frameworks for planning, aligning, and governing content programs that connect audience needs to business objectives.

## Core Principle

**Every piece of content must answer three questions before production begins: Who is it for? What should they do after reading? How will we measure success?** Content without documented answers to all three is not strategic content.

## Audience Research and Mapping

### Audience Segmentation Framework

| Dimension | Definition | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Role | Job title and daily responsibilities | VP of Marketing at B2B SaaS |
| Stage | Position in the buying journey | Consideration (comparing solutions) |
| Sophistication | Knowledge level on the topic | Intermediate (knows basics, needs depth) |
| Motivation | What they hope to gain from content | Tactical frameworks to present to leadership |
| Objection | What might prevent action | "We don't have budget for another tool" |
| Preferred Format | How they consume information | Long-form articles during commute |

### Persona Development

```markdown
## Content Persona Template

### Name: [Descriptive name, e.g., "Scaling Sarah"]
**Role:** [Job title and responsibilities]
**Company:** [Size, industry, growth stage]

**Goals:**
- [What they want to achieve professionally]
- [What content helps them accomplish]

**Pain Points:**
- [Frustration 1: specific and observed]
- [Frustration 2: specific and observed]

**Content Preferences:**
- Formats: [Blog, video, podcast, newsletter]
- Channels: [LinkedIn, Google, email, community]
- Frequency: [Daily digest vs. weekly deep dive]
- Tone: [Tactical and direct vs. inspirational and narrative]

**Trigger Events:**
- [What causes them to search for this content]
- [Seasonal or business-cycle patterns]
```

## Content Pillar Development

### Pillar Selection Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | Evaluation |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Audience demand | High | Search volume, community questions, sales call topics |
| Business relevance | High | Connects to product value proposition |
| Competitive gap | Medium | Underserved or poorly served by competitors |
| Internal expertise | Medium | Team can credibly and deeply cover this topic |
| Longevity | Medium | Topic has staying power beyond a news cycle |
| Repurposability | Low | Pillar can spawn multiple derivative formats |

### Content-Market Fit Validation

```text
Step 1: Identify audience pain points from sales calls, support tickets, community forums
Step 2: Map pain points to potential content topics
Step 3: Assess competitive landscape (what exists, what's missing, what's outdated)
Step 4: Validate demand with keyword data and social listening
Step 5: Pilot with minimum viable content (social post, newsletter section)
Step 6: Measure engagement signals before investing in long-form production
```

## Editorial Calendar Management

### Calendar Architecture

```text
Annual Plan
├── Quarterly Themes (aligned to business objectives)
│   ├── Monthly Focus Areas
│   │   ├── Weekly Content Slots
│   │   │   ├── Publication date + time
│   │   │   ├── Content type + format
│   │   │   ├── Owner + reviewer
│   │   │   ├── Status (ideation → published)
│   │   │   └── Distribution channels
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
└── Evergreen Library (always-on, non-dated content)
```

### Content Mix Ratio

| Funnel Stage | Content Purpose | Target Mix |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| TOFU (Awareness) | Educate, attract, build trust | 50-60% |
| MOFU (Consideration) | Compare, evaluate, demonstrate | 25-35% |
| BOFU (Decision) | Convert, validate, reassure | 10-20% |

## Content Governance

### Governance Framework

| Domain | Standard | Enforcement |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Brand voice | Style guide + tone matrix | Editorial review gate |
| Legal compliance | Disclaimer templates, disclosure rules | Legal review for regulated topics |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.1 AA for web content | Accessibility checklist at publish |
| Data accuracy | Source citation, fact-check process | Substantive edit pass |
| Content freshness | Maximum age thresholds by type | Quarterly content audit |
| Taxonomy | Controlled vocabulary for tags and categories | CMS enforcement |

### Content Audit Cadence

```text
Monthly:  Review top 20 performing pages (maintain and optimize)
Quarterly: Audit all content published > 6 months ago (refresh or archive)
Annually: Full inventory audit (consolidate, redirect, retire)
```

## Measurement Framework

### Content Performance Tiers

| Tier | Metrics | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| Reach | Pageviews, impressions, unique visitors | Is the content being found? |
| Engagement | Time on page, scroll depth, bounce rate | Is it being consumed? |
| Conversion | Email signups, downloads, demo requests | Is it driving action? |
| Revenue | Pipeline influenced, deals closed, LTV | Is it moving the business? |

## Common Pitfalls

```text
- Strategy by committee: Too many stakeholders dilute the editorial voice and slow production
- Calendar worship: Publishing to fill slots instead of waiting for quality content
- Persona fiction: Building personas from assumptions instead of observed behavior
- Pillar drift: Straying from core pillars to chase trending topics without strategic fit
- Measurement paralysis: Tracking 30 metrics instead of the 3-5 that matter for each content type
- Ignoring distribution: Spending 90% of effort on creation and 10% on promotion (invert this)
```
