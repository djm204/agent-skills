# SEO Content

Frameworks for creating content that ranks in search engines while serving genuine audience needs and maintaining editorial quality.

## Core Principle

**Write for search intent, not for search engines.** Google rewards content that best satisfies the user's query. Optimization is the process of aligning your content with what the searcher actually needs, not gaming an algorithm.

## Search Intent Classification

### Intent Types and Content Mapping

| Intent Type | Searcher Goal | Optimal Format | Ranking Signals |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| Informational | Learn or understand | Blog, guide, tutorial, FAQ | Depth, comprehensiveness, freshness |
| Navigational | Find a specific page | Brand page, product page | Brand relevance, site authority |
| Commercial | Compare and evaluate | Comparison, review, listicle | Objectivity, specificity, trust signals |
| Transactional | Take an action | Landing page, pricing page | Clear CTA, schema markup, page speed |

### SERP Analysis Checklist

| Element | What to Examine |
|---------|----------------|
| Featured snippet | What format does Google display? (list, table, paragraph) |
| People Also Ask | What related questions does Google surface? |
| Top 5 results | What content format, length, and depth rank highest? |
| SERP features | Videos, images, knowledge panels, local pack present? |
| Content freshness | Are top results recent or evergreen? |
| Domain authority | Are top results high-authority domains or niche sites? |

## Keyword Research

### Research Workflow

```text
Step 1: Seed keyword brainstorm
    │   Sources: customer questions, sales objections, support tickets
    │

    │   Ahrefs, SEMrush, Google Keyword Planner, AlsoAsked, AnswerThePublic
    │
Step 3: Intent classification
    │   Tag each keyword: informational / commercial / transactional
    │
Step 4: Difficulty and opportunity scoring
    │   Balance search volume against keyword difficulty and current rankings
    │
Step 5: Keyword clustering
    │   Group semantically related keywords under topic clusters
    │
Step 6: Gap analysis
        Identify keywords competitors rank for that you do not
```

### Keyword Prioritization Matrix

| Factor | Weight | How to Assess |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Search volume | Medium | Monthly search volume from keyword tools |
| Keyword difficulty | High | Competitiveness score; lower = easier to rank |
| Business relevance | High | How closely the keyword relates to your offering |
| Current position | Medium | Already ranking (page 2-3) = optimization opportunity |
| Conversion potential | High | Commercial/transactional intent keywords drive revenue |

## Topic Cluster Architecture

### Building Pillar and Cluster Content

```text
PILLAR PAGE: "Content Marketing Strategy" (3,000-5,000 words)
    │
    ├── Cluster: "How to Create a Content Calendar" (1,500 words)
    ├── Cluster: "Content Marketing ROI Measurement" (2,000 words)
    ├── Cluster: "Blog Post Templates for B2B" (1,200 words)
    ├── Cluster: "Content Distribution Channels" (1,800 words)
    ├── Cluster: "Content Repurposing Guide" (1,500 words)
    └── Cluster: "Editorial Workflow Best Practices" (1,400 words)

Internal Linking Rules:
- Every cluster article links back to the pillar page
- The pillar page links to every cluster article
- Cluster articles cross-link where topically relevant
- Anchor text is descriptive, not "click here"
```

## On-Page Optimization

### Essential On-Page Elements

| Element | Best Practice | Common Mistake |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Title tag | Primary keyword near front; under 60 chars | Stuffing multiple keywords |
| Meta description | Compelling summary; 150-160 chars; includes keyword | Duplicate or missing descriptions |
| H1 | One per page; matches primary intent | Multiple H1s or generic titles |
| H2-H3 hierarchy | Logical nesting; includes secondary keywords naturally | Skipping heading levels |
| URL slug | Short, hyphenated, descriptive | Long URLs with unnecessary parameters |
| First 100 words | Mention primary keyword naturally | Delaying the topic introduction |
| Internal links | 3-5 relevant links per article | Linking for the sake of linking |
| External links | 2-3 authoritative sources | Linking to competitors or low-quality sites |
| Image alt text | Descriptive; keyword where natural | "image1.jpg" or keyword stuffing |
| Schema markup | FAQ, HowTo, Article, Breadcrumb | Missing structured data entirely |

## Content Refresh Strategy

### Refresh Decision Framework

| Signal | Action | Priority |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Ranking position dropped > 5 spots | Competitive analysis + content rewrite | High |
| Traffic down > 20% quarter-over-quarter | Full content update with fresh data | High |
| High impressions, low CTR | Rewrite title tag and meta description | Medium |
| Outdated statistics or examples | Update facts, keep structure | Medium |
| New subtopics emerging in SERP | Add new sections to existing content | Medium |
| Content older than 18 months | Schedule for comprehensive review | Low |

### Refresh vs. New Content Decision

```text
Does a page already exist that targets this keyword?
    │
    ├── YES → Is it ranking on page 1-3?
    │         │
    │         ├── YES → Refresh and optimize the existing page
    │         │
    │         └── NO → Evaluate: rewrite existing or create new?
    │                  Consider: domain authority, backlinks, content quality
    │
    └── NO → Create new content targeting this keyword
```

## Common Pitfalls

```text
- Keyword stuffing: Forcing keywords into every sentence; damages readability and trust
- Ignoring intent: Creating a blog post when the SERP clearly wants a tool or calculator
- Thin content: Publishing 500-word posts on topics that require 2,000+ words of depth
- Cannibalization: Multiple pages targeting the same keyword compete against each other
- Neglecting refreshes: Letting top-performing content decay without updating it
- Over-optimizing: Writing for crawlers instead of humans; unnatural phrasing and structure
```
