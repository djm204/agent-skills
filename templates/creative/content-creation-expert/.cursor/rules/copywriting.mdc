# Copywriting

Principles and frameworks for persuasive writing across headlines, landing pages, email sequences, ad copy, and conversion-focused content.

## Core Principle

**Great copy is clear before it is clever.** The reader should never have to decode your meaning. Persuasion comes from understanding the audience's pain and presenting a credible solution, not from wordplay.

## Persuasion Frameworks

### Framework Selection Guide

| Framework | Structure | Best For | Example Use |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| AIDA | Attention - Interest - Desire - Action | Landing pages, ads | Product launch page |
| PAS | Problem - Agitate - Solve | Email sequences, sales pages | Cold outreach email |
| BAB | Before - After - Bridge | Case studies, testimonials | Customer success story |
| 4Ps | Promise - Picture - Proof - Push | Direct response copy | Webinar registration |
| FAB | Feature - Advantage - Benefit | Product descriptions | Feature announcement |
| QUEST | Qualify - Understand - Educate - Stimulate - Transition | Long-form sales | Sales page |

## Headline Writing

### Headline Quality Checklist

| Element | Test |
|---------|------|
| Specificity | Does it name the audience or outcome? |
| Benefit | Does the reader know what they'll gain? |
| Curiosity | Is there a reason to click beyond the headline? |
| Clarity | Can someone understand it in under 3 seconds? |
| Length | Under 70 characters for SEO; under 40 for social? |

## Voice and Tone

### Voice vs. Tone Distinction

```text
Voice = The consistent personality of the brand (does not change)
Tone  = The emotional adjustment for context (changes per situation)

Example:
  Voice: Direct, knowledgeable, approachable
  Tone (error page): Empathetic, reassuring
  Tone (product launch): Enthusiastic, confident
  Tone (pricing page): Transparent, no-pressure
```

### Tone Calibration Matrix

| Situation | Formality | Emotion | Pace | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|------|---------|
| Blog post | Conversational | Curious | Steady | "Here's what we found..." |
| Error message | Professional | Empathetic | Calm | "Something went wrong. Here's how to fix it." |
| Ad copy | Casual | Urgent | Fast | "Stop guessing. Start growing." |
| White paper | Formal | Authoritative | Measured | "The data suggests a significant shift..." |
| Onboarding email | Warm | Encouraging | Gentle | "Welcome! Let's get you set up in 5 minutes." |

## Email Copywriting

### Subject Line Rules

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| Under 50 characters | Mobile truncation starts at ~40 characters |
| No ALL CAPS | Triggers spam filters and reads as shouting |
| Personalization sparingly | Overuse trains readers to ignore it |
| Specificity over mystery | "3 SEO fixes for your pricing page" beats "You need to see this" |
| Preview text matters | First 90 characters of body appear in inbox preview |

### Email Structure

```text
Subject line: [Specific benefit or curiosity hook]
Preview text: [Extends the subject, doesn't repeat it]

Opening line: [Personal, relevant, or surprising]
    │
Body: [One idea, clearly communicated]
    │   - Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
    │   - One link maximum in body
    │   - Bolded key phrase for scanners
    │
CTA: [Single, clear action]
    │   - Button or linked text
    │   - "Read the framework" over "Click here"
    │
Sign-off: [Human, consistent with brand voice]
```

## Landing Page Copy

### Conversion Copy Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| One page, one goal | Every element supports a single conversion action |
| Benefit before feature | Lead with what the reader gains, not what the product does |
| Social proof placement | Near the CTA, not buried in the middle |
| Objection handling | FAQ section addresses the top 3-5 reasons people hesitate |
| Scannability | Headers, bullets, and bold text tell the story for skimmers |
| Urgency must be real | Fake countdowns and false scarcity destroy trust |

### CTA Button Copy

```markdown
## Weak vs. Strong CTAs

Weak: "Submit" / "Click Here" / "Learn More"
Strong: "Get the Free Template" / "Start Your Audit" / "See Pricing"

Rules:
- Start with a verb
- Name the value received
- Match the commitment level (free content = low friction CTA)
- Button text should complete the sentence "I want to..."
```

## Common Pitfalls

```text
- Feature dumping: Listing features without translating them into reader benefits
- Cleverness trap: Prioritizing puns and wordplay over clarity of message
- CTA overload: Multiple competing calls to action that dilute conversion
- Fake urgency: "Limited time!" on an offer that never expires; destroys credibility
- Audience mismatch: Writing at expert level for beginners (or vice versa)
- Ignoring the fold: Burying the value proposition below the initial viewport
```
