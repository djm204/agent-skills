# Multimedia Production

Frameworks for video scripting, podcast production, visual content briefs, and cross-format content repurposing.

## Core Principle

**The medium shapes the message.** Every format has unique strengths and constraints. Effective multimedia production adapts the core idea to each format's native language rather than forcing a blog post into a video or a podcast into a carousel.

## Video Content

### Video Types and Parameters

| Type | Duration | Platform | Production Level | Goal |
|------|----------|----------|-----------------|------|
| Short-form (Reels/TikTok) | 15-90 sec | Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts | Low-medium | Awareness, reach |
| Explainer | 2-5 min | YouTube, landing pages | Medium | Education, consideration |
| Tutorial | 5-15 min | YouTube, course platform | Medium-high | Skill-building, authority |
| Webinar | 30-60 min | Zoom, LinkedIn Live | Medium | Lead generation, depth |
| Brand story | 1-3 min | Website, social | High | Trust, emotional connection |
| Testimonial | 1-3 min | Website, sales enablement | Medium | Social proof, conversion |

### Video Script Template

```markdown
## Video Script: [Title]
**Duration:** [Target length]
**Platform:** [Primary distribution channel]
**Objective:** [What should the viewer do after watching?]

### Hook (0:00-0:10)
[Opening line: bold claim, surprising stat, or direct question]
VISUAL: [What the viewer sees]
AUDIO: [Background music or sound direction]

### Context (0:10-0:30)
[Why this matters to the viewer right now]
VISUAL: [Talking head, text overlay, or B-roll]

### Main Content
#### Point 1: [Key idea] (0:30-X:XX)
SCRIPT: [Spoken words]
VISUAL: [Screen share, animation, or demonstration]
TRANSITION: [How to bridge to point 2]

#### Point 2: [Key idea] (X:XX-X:XX)
SCRIPT: [Spoken words]
VISUAL: [Supporting visuals]

#### Point 3: [Key idea] (X:XX-X:XX)
SCRIPT: [Spoken words]
VISUAL: [Supporting visuals]

### Summary (X:XX-X:XX)
[Recap the three key takeaways in one sentence each]

### CTA (final 10-15 sec)
[Clear next step: subscribe, download, visit link in description]
VISUAL: [End screen with subscribe button and related video]
```

## Podcast Production

## Content Repurposing

### Repurposing Workflow

```text
PILLAR CONTENT (e.g., 3,000-word guide)
    │
    ├── Extract → 5-10 social posts (key stats, quotes, tips)
    ├── Condense → 1 email newsletter section (300 words)
    ├── Visualize → 1 infographic or carousel (key framework)
    ├── Record → 1 video summary (3-5 min explainer)
    ├── Discuss → 1 podcast segment (10-15 min deep dive)
    ├── Atomize → 3-5 tweet/thread ideas
    └── Gate → 1 downloadable resource (checklist, template)
```

### Format Adaptation Guidelines

| From | To | Adaptation Notes |
|------|----|-----------------|
| Blog post | Video script | Lead with the hook; cut setup by 50%; add visual direction |
| Blog post | Social carousel | One slide per key point; max 10 slides; end with CTA |
| Podcast | Blog post | Structure around key quotes; add context and links |
| Webinar | Blog series | One post per major section; add depth lost in live format |
| Research report | Infographic | Highlight 3-5 most surprising findings; simplify data viz |
| Case study | Testimonial clips | Pull 2-3 strongest outcome quotes; add context overlay |

## Common Pitfalls

```text
- Copy-paste repurposing: Dumping a blog post transcript into a video script without adapting
- Ignoring platform norms: Posting the same content identically across all channels
- Over-producing: Investing in high production value when the audience values authenticity
- No hook: Starting videos or podcasts with lengthy introductions instead of immediate value
- Missing accessibility: No captions on video, no transcripts for podcasts, no alt text on graphics
- Orphaned assets: Creating multimedia content without linking back to pillar content for SEO value
