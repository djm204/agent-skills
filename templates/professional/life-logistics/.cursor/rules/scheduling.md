# Appointment Scheduling Optimization

Guidelines for scheduling appointments efficiently across medical, financial, home service, and personal service providers.

## Scheduling Principles

1. **Book proactively** - Schedule recurring appointments 3-6 months in advance and request cancellation waitlist placement for earlier slots
2. **Batch by location** - Group appointments in the same geographic area or provider network on the same day to minimize travel
3. **Optimize time slots** - Early morning and first-after-lunch slots have the shortest wait times at most medical offices
4. **Respect seasonality** - Schedule annual exams in Q1 when deductibles reset and provider calendars are less full
5. **Maintain a provider database** - Track every provider's booking method, lead time, cancellation policy, and portal access

## Priority Classification

Classify every scheduling request before acting:

- **Urgent + Time-Sensitive**: Acute medical issues, insurance enrollment deadlines, legal filing deadlines. Act immediately.
- **Important + Recurring**: Annual physicals, dental cleanings, vehicle inspections, HVAC service. Schedule per annual calendar.
- **Optimization**: Second opinions, financial reviews, insurance audits. Schedule during low-demand periods.
- **Flexible**: Elective services, non-urgent improvements, exploratory consultations. Fill gaps in calendar.

## Scheduling Workflow

1. Check the annual scheduling calendar for what is due in the next 60 days
2. Verify insurance network status of the target provider before booking
3. Check for any required referrals or pre-authorizations
4. Book using the provider's preferred method (portal, phone, app)
5. Request cancellation waitlist if the earliest slot is too far out
6. Add appointment to calendar with address, documents to bring, and preparation notes
7. Set reminder for 48 hours before (confirm appointment) and 24 hours before (prepare documents)
8. After the visit, schedule the next occurrence immediately if recurring

## Calendar Integration

- Use a dedicated calendar layer or color code for logistics appointments
- Include in each calendar entry: provider name, address, phone number, portal link, documents needed, co-pay amount
- Set two reminders per appointment: one for preparation and one for departure time accounting for travel
- Block travel time before and after appointments to avoid scheduling conflicts

## Provider Database Fields

For every provider, maintain at minimum:

- Name, specialty, address, phone, portal URL
- Insurance network status and verification date
- Typical lead time for next available appointment
- Cancellation policy (notice period and fee)
- Preferred booking method
- After-hours or emergency contact protocol
- Personal notes on quality, wait times, and communication style

## Rescheduling and Cancellation

When an appointment must be rescheduled:

1. Check the provider's cancellation policy to avoid fees (most require 24-48 hours notice)
2. Rebook before cancelling to maintain continuity and avoid losing the slot entirely
3. If cancelling a specialist with long lead times, request placement on the next available waitlist immediately
4. Update the calendar entry with the new date and adjust any dependent appointments (lab work before a follow-up, for example)

## Annual Calendar Template

Follow the month-by-month scheduling template in CLAUDE.md. Adjust based on personal health needs, household size, vehicle count, and geographic factors. The calendar should be reviewed and updated at the start of each quarter.
