# Personal Finance Optimization

Guidelines for reducing recurring costs, optimizing insurance plans, maximizing rewards and benefits, and maintaining a systematic approach to household financial management.

## Optimization Principles

1. **Measure before optimizing** - Collect at least 6-12 months of spending data before recommending changes
2. **Focus on the big categories first** - Housing, insurance, transportation, and utilities yield the largest savings
3. **Optimization is recurring** - A one-time review is not enough. Financial optimization requires quarterly and annual review cadences
4. **Tax-advantaged accounts first** - Maximize HSA, FSA, and retirement account contributions before optimizing discretionary spending
5. **Rewards stacking** - Layer credit card rewards, loyalty programs, employer benefits, and promotional offers for maximum value

## Insurance Optimization Methodology

### Usage Pattern Analysis

Before comparing any insurance plan:

1. Pull 24 months of claims history and out-of-pocket spending
2. List every provider, medication, and service used with frequency
3. Identify any planned procedures or changes in the next 12 months
4. Verify which providers are in-network for each plan under consideration
5. Calculate total annual cost under best-case, expected-case, and worst-case usage scenarios

### Plan Comparison

For every insurance comparison, calculate total annual cost as:

- (Monthly Premium x 12) + Expected Out-of-Pocket Based on Usage - Tax Savings from HSA/FSA - Employer Contributions

Weight the scenarios: 50% best case, 35% expected case, 15% worst case. The plan with the lowest weighted total annual cost is typically the best choice, subject to network adequacy.

### Annual Insurance Shopping Schedule

- **45-60 days before renewal**: Request current policy declarations page and begin competitor quoting
- **30-45 days before renewal**: Complete comparisons, negotiate with current carrier using competitor quotes
- **14-30 days before renewal**: Make final decision and bind new policy if switching
- **Day of renewal**: Verify new policy is active and old policy terminates without gap

## Expense Category Strategies

### High-Impact Categories

- **Housing**: Review refinance opportunities when rates drop 0.5%+ below current rate. Appeal property tax assessments when comparable sales support a lower valuation. Request PMI removal at 80% LTV.
- **Insurance**: Shop all policies annually. Bundle home and auto for 10-25% discount. Optimize deductibles based on emergency fund size.
- **Telecom**: Negotiate annually with retention department. Right-size data and channel plans to actual usage.
- **Subscriptions**: Audit quarterly. Cancel anything unused in the past 30 days. Negotiate annual rates for keepers.

### Credit Card Rewards

- Assign spending categories to the card with the highest reward rate for that category
- Set recurring bills on the card that offers the best rate for subscription or utility payments
- Review reward program changes quarterly as issuers frequently modify category bonuses
- Redeem rewards at their highest-value option (often travel or statement credit, not merchandise)

## Financial Review Cadence

Follow the review schedule in CLAUDE.md:

- **Weekly**: Transaction review for unauthorized charges, verify autopay processing
- **Monthly**: Budget reconciliation, upcoming renewal check for the next 60 days
- **Quarterly**: Subscription audit, insurance adequacy review, rewards optimization check
- **Annually**: Full insurance shopping, tax withholding review, provider rate comparison, credit report check
- **Event-triggered**: Any rate increase, life change, claim, or contract expiration

## Verification Protocol

After any financial change (new rate, plan switch, account modification):

1. Document the change with confirmation number, effective date, and expected impact
2. Set a 30-day reminder to verify the change on the next statement
3. If the change is not reflected, escalate immediately with documentation
4. Update the renewal tracker with the new terms and next review date
