# Bill Negotiation Strategies

Guidelines for negotiating bills, disputing charges, and reducing costs across service providers, medical bills, insurance, and subscriptions.

## Negotiation Principles

1. **Never negotiate without data** - Gather competitive quotes, market rates, and account history before contacting any provider
2. **Be specific** - Have a target rate and a walk-away point defined before the call begins
3. **Leverage tenure and loyalty** - Long-standing accounts with good payment history are retention department assets
4. **Ask for retention or loyalty departments** - Front-line billing representatives typically have limited authority to adjust rates
5. **Document every interaction** - Record date, time, representative name, reference number, and outcome

## Bill Audit Protocol

Before negotiating, conduct a full audit:

1. Collect the last 12 months of statements for the target provider
2. Calculate total annual spend
3. Identify any rate increases, new fees, or surcharges added over time
4. Research current market rates for equivalent service from competitors
5. Check for billing errors, duplicate charges, or services not received
6. Rank providers by annual savings potential and negotiate in that order

## Negotiation Workflow

1. **Prepare**: Complete the pre-call section of the negotiation tracking template
2. **Call**: Request the retention or loyalty department. State your case clearly and calmly
3. **Anchor**: Lead with the competitor rate or market benchmark as your reference point
4. **Listen**: Let the representative make the first concrete offer
5. **Counter**: If the offer does not meet your target, counter with your specific number and justification
6. **Escalate**: If the representative cannot meet your target, politely ask for a supervisor or callback from a manager
7. **Document**: Record the outcome, confirmation number, and new terms
8. **Verify**: Set a 30-day reminder to confirm the change appears on the next statement

## Medical Bill Negotiation

Medical bills require a distinct approach:

- Always request an itemized bill with CPT codes, not a summary statement
- Verify every CPT code matches a service actually received
- Compare charges to Medicare reimbursement rates as a fair-price benchmark
- Ask about self-pay discounts (typically 20-40% off billed charges)
- Request a payment plan with zero or low interest rather than paying a disputed amount in full
- If a bill was processed incorrectly through insurance, request reprocessing before negotiating the patient portion
- Escalate to the billing department supervisor or patient advocate for unresolved disputes

## Subscription Management

- Treat every subscription renewal as a negotiation event
- The most effective retention trigger is stating intent to cancel
- Annual payment plans are almost always cheaper than monthly (15-30% savings typical)
- Set calendar reminders 14 days before any free trial converts to paid
- Maintain a list of all active subscriptions with renewal dates and cancellation methods

## Tracking and Follow-Up

Use the negotiation tracking template in CLAUDE.md for every negotiation. Key fields:

- Current rate, competitor rate, target rate, walk-away point
- Call log with representative name and reference numbers
- Outcome with new terms and expiration date
- Monthly and annual savings calculated
- Re-negotiation reminder date set (typically 30 days before promotional rate expires)
