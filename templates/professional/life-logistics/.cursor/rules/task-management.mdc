# Task Management and Delegation

Guidelines for classifying, automating, tracking, and delegating recurring and one-time life logistics tasks.

## Task Management Principles

1. **Systematize before delegating** - A task without a documented process cannot be delegated reliably
2. **Calendar is the single source of truth** - Every deadline, renewal, and recurring task must exist in the calendar with appropriate lead-time reminders
3. **Batch similar tasks** - Group phone calls, errands, and administrative work into dedicated blocks rather than scattering them throughout the week
4. **Redundant reminders for high-stakes items** - Insurance deadlines, tax filings, and legal due dates get reminders at 60, 30, 14, and 3 days before
5. **Review and prune regularly** - Audit automated systems and recurring tasks quarterly to remove obsolete items and update changed processes

## Task Classification

Every task should be classified along two axes:

### By Recurrence
- **Fixed schedule**: Occurs on a predictable cadence (monthly bill, annual renewal). Automate or calendar.
- **Event-triggered**: Occurs in response to a specific condition (rate increase letter, appliance failure). Set monitoring alerts.
- **One-time**: Occurs once (initial provider research, new account setup). Track to completion and archive.

### By Handling Method
- **Fully automated**: Autopay, auto-refill, auto-renewal with periodic verification checks
- **Calendar-driven manual**: Requires human action but is triggered by a calendar reminder with a checklist
- **Delegatable**: Can be handed off to another person or service with a clear brief
- **Personal only**: Requires your specific presence, judgment, or authorization

## Automation Standards

For any task set to autopay or auto-renewal:

1. Verify the funding source has sufficient balance or credit
2. Set a calendar reminder on the expected processing date to verify the charge
3. Review automated charges quarterly to catch rate changes or unauthorized modifications
4. Maintain a master list of all autopay arrangements with the payment method used
5. When changing payment methods (new card, new bank account), update all autopay links immediately

## Deadline and Renewal Tracking

Maintain a centralized renewal tracker (template in CLAUDE.md) with:

- Item name and provider
- Renewal or deadline date
- Required action and decision authority
- Lead time needed for research or comparison shopping
- Current status (pending, in-progress, completed)

Review the tracker at the start of each month. Flag any items with deadlines in the next 60 days that have not been started.

## Delegation Protocol

When delegating a task:

1. **Define the task clearly**: What needs to be done, why it matters, and when it is due
2. **Set boundaries**: What decisions can be made independently versus what requires approval
3. **Provide context**: Relevant account numbers, provider contacts, budget limits, and preferences
4. **Specify deliverables**: What the completed task looks like and how results should be reported back
5. **Set a check-in point**: For longer tasks, define an intermediate check-in before the final deadline

Use the delegation handoff template in CLAUDE.md for any task that involves provider interaction, financial decisions, or scheduling on someone's behalf.

## Household Management Integration

Household maintenance tasks follow the same classification and tracking system:

- Monthly, quarterly, biannual, and annual maintenance items each get calendar entries
- Service provider appointments are booked with the scheduling rules from the scheduling guide
- Home inventory is updated whenever items are purchased, replaced, or disposed of
- Warranty information is tracked with expiration dates in the renewal tracker

## Quarterly Review Checklist

Every quarter, review the entire task management system:

- [ ] Are all autopay arrangements still on the correct payment method?
- [ ] Have any recurring tasks become obsolete or changed in frequency?
- [ ] Are there any deadlines in the next 90 days without assigned action plans?
- [ ] Has any provider changed their billing, scheduling, or service terms?
- [ ] Are delegation handoffs being completed on time and to standard?
- [ ] Does the home maintenance calendar reflect actual conditions (new appliances, completed repairs)?
