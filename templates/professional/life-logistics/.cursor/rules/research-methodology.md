# Vendor and Provider Research Methodology

Guidelines for evaluating, comparing, and selecting service providers across medical, home service, financial, and general vendor categories.

## Research Principles

1. **Structured evaluation over gut feel** - Use weighted scorecards with explicit criteria for every provider comparison
2. **Minimum viable shortlist** - Screen broadly, then narrow to 3-5 candidates for detailed evaluation
3. **Verify credentials independently** - Never rely solely on a provider's self-reported qualifications
4. **Standardize the interview** - Ask the same questions of every candidate to enable fair comparison
5. **Separate research from decision** - Gather data first, then evaluate. Mixing the two leads to confirmation bias

## Research Pipeline

Follow this sequence for every provider search:

1. **Define requirements** - List must-have criteria, nice-to-have preferences, budget range, and timeline
2. **Source candidates** - Use insurance directories, professional associations, verified review platforms, and personal referrals
3. **Screen and shortlist** - Verify licensing, check for complaints, confirm insurance network status, review ratings with a minimum sample size of 20 reviews
4. **Evaluate** - Contact each candidate, ask standardized questions, request written estimates, and score using the Provider Evaluation Scorecard
5. **Select and onboard** - Confirm terms, complete intake paperwork, set up portal access, and schedule initial service
6. **Post-service review** - After the first visit or service, score actual experience against expectations and update the provider database

## Provider Evaluation Scorecard

Use these weighted criteria (adjust weights based on the specific service type):

- **Cost/Value (25%)**: Total cost relative to market rate and quality delivered
- **Quality of Service (25%)**: Expertise, thoroughness, communication, and outcomes
- **Convenience/Location (15%)**: Proximity, parking, hours of operation, virtual options
- **Availability (10%)**: Lead time for appointments, responsiveness to inquiries
- **Reviews/Reputation (10%)**: Aggregate ratings from verified platforms, complaint history
- **Insurance/Network (10%)**: In-network status, accepted payment methods, billing transparency
- **Cancellation Flexibility (5%)**: Ease of rescheduling, penalty policies

Score each criterion 1-10, multiply by weight, and sum for a total weighted score.

## Source Reliability Hierarchy

Not all information sources are equal. Prioritize in this order:

1. Personal experience or direct referrals from trusted contacts
2. Professional licensing board records and disciplinary databases
3. Verified review platforms with identity confirmation (Healthgrades, Zocdoc)
4. General review platforms with sufficient volume (Google Reviews 50+ ratings)
5. Provider self-reported information (verify independently)
6. Social media mentions and informal recommendations (lowest reliability)

## Category-Specific Research Notes

### Medical Providers
- Verify board certification through the relevant specialty board
- Check state medical board for disciplinary actions
- Confirm hospital affiliations if relevant to your needs
- Prioritize providers who offer patient portal messaging for non-urgent questions

### Home Service Providers
- Verify active licensing, bonding, and insurance coverage
- Request and check at least three references from recent jobs
- Require written estimates before any work begins
- Confirm warranty terms and post-service support in writing

### Financial Service Providers
- Verify fiduciary status (fee-only advisors have fewer conflicts of interest)
- Check credentials through FINRA BrokerCheck or SEC Investment Adviser search
- Request a clear, written fee schedule before engagement
- Ask for sample deliverables (financial plans, reports) to assess quality

## Documentation

Add every researched provider to the provider database, including those not selected. Record the reason for rejection to avoid repeating research if circumstances change later.
