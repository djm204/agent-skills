# Fitness Programming

Guidelines for exercise prescription, periodization, recovery protocols, and injury prevention within a whole-person wellness framework.

## Programming Principles

- **Readiness before intensity** - Always check the daily readiness score before prescribing workout intensity; never program a hard session on a low-readiness day
- **Progressive overload with guardrails** - Increase training stress by no more than 10% week-over-week for volume or load; larger jumps invite injury
- **Minimum effective dose** - Prescribe the least amount of training that produces measurable progress; more is not always better
- **Movement quality before load** - Technique mastery at lighter loads precedes heavy loading; form breakdown under fatigue is a signal to stop the set
- **Recovery is part of the program** - Deload weeks, rest days, and active recovery sessions are planned and scheduled, not reactive

## Exercise Prescription Framework

| Parameter | Beginner (0-12 months) | Intermediate (1-3 years) | Advanced (3+ years) |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Weekly frequency | 2-3 full body sessions | 3-5 sessions (split) | 4-6 sessions (specialized split) |
| Intensity (RPE) | 5-6 / 10 | 6-8 / 10 | 7-10 / 10 (periodized) |
| Sets per muscle group per week | 6-10 | 10-16 | 14-22 |
| Rep ranges | 8-15 (technique focus) | 6-12 (hypertrophy) + 3-6 (strength) | Mixed (periodized phases) |
| Progression model | Add reps first, then load | Wave loading, double progression | Block periodization, conjugate methods |
| Deload frequency | Every 6-8 weeks | Every 4-6 weeks | Every 3-5 weeks |

## Readiness-Based Session Selection

| Readiness Score | Session Type | Volume Adjustment | Intensity Adjustment |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 85-100 (Peak) | Heavy compounds, PR attempts, high-intensity intervals | 100% planned | 100% planned |
| 70-84 (Good) | Normal training session as programmed | 100% planned | 100% planned |
| 55-69 (Moderate) | Technique work, moderate loads, steady-state cardio | Reduce 20-30% | Reduce 10-20% |
| 40-54 (Low) | Active recovery, mobility, light cardio | Reduce 50-60% | Cap at RPE 5 |
| Below 40 (Rest) | Full rest day or gentle walk | No structured training | No structured training |

## Periodization Structure

```text
Mesocycle Rotation (typical annual plan)
├── Accumulation Block (3-5 weeks)
│   ├── Higher volume, moderate intensity
│   ├── Build work capacity and muscle
│   └── RPE 6-8 target
├── Intensification Block (3-4 weeks)
│   ├── Lower volume, higher intensity
│   ├── Build maximal strength
│   └── RPE 8-9 target
├── Realization/Peak Block (1-2 weeks)
│   ├── Low volume, high intensity
│   ├── Test or compete
│   └── RPE 9-10 on key lifts
├── Deload (1 week between each block)
│   ├── Volume at 40-60% of previous block
│   ├── Intensity at 70-80% of previous block
│   └── Focus: recovery, mobility, technique
└── Active Recovery Phase (1-2 weeks annually)
    ├── Unstructured movement and play
    ├── Address accumulated imbalances
    └── Mental refresh from structured training
```

## Cardiovascular Training Integration

| Training Goal | Cardio Type | Frequency | Duration | Intensity |
|--------------|------------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| General health | Mixed (walk, bike, swim) | 3-5x/week | 20-40 min | Zone 2 (conversational pace) |
| Fat loss support | Low-impact steady state | 2-4x/week | 30-45 min | Zone 2, post-resistance training |
| Endurance building | Progressive long sessions | 3-5x/week | 30-90 min | Zone 2 base + Zone 4 intervals |
| Strength athlete (minimize interference) | Walking, cycling | 2-3x/week | 20-30 min | Zone 1-2 only |
| HIIT (conditioning) | Intervals (bike, row, sled) | 1-2x/week | 15-25 min | Zone 4-5 work, Zone 1-2 recovery |

## Recovery Protocol Triggers

| Signal | Protocol | Duration |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Readiness score below 50 for 2+ days | Mandatory deload or rest days | Until readiness returns above 60 |
| Persistent soreness in a muscle group > 72 hours | Avoid loading that group; add foam rolling and light stretching | Until soreness resolves to 3/10 or below |
| Resting HR elevated > 5 bpm above baseline for 3+ days | Reduce all training volume 50%; prioritize sleep | 3-5 days minimum |
| HRV trend declining for 5+ days | Switch to active recovery sessions only | Until HRV stabilizes at baseline |
| Joint pain (sharp, not muscular DOMS) | Stop loading that joint; seek professional assessment | Until cleared |
| Mood and motivation declining alongside training metrics | Full deload week with emphasis on enjoyable, unstructured movement | 5-7 days |

## Injury Prevention Guidelines

| Area | Strategy | Frequency |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Warm-up | 5-10 min progressive: general movement, specific activation, ramp-up sets | Every session |
| Push/pull balance | Track weekly volume parity between pushing and pulling movements within 10% | Weekly audit |
| Posterior chain work | Include glute, hamstring, and upper back exercises every training day | Every session |
| Mobility work | Target individual restrictions (hip, thoracic spine, ankle, shoulder) | Minimum 3x/week |
| Load management | Stay within 10% weekly volume increase; use RPE to auto-regulate | Per session |
| Cool-down | 5 min light movement + static stretching for worked muscle groups | Every session |

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Program Hopping

Wrong: Switch training programs every 2-3 weeks because progress is not immediately visible.

Right: Commit to a well-designed program for a minimum of 6-8 weeks before evaluating effectiveness. Adaptation takes time.

### 2. Ignoring Readiness Signals

Wrong: Follow the program exactly as written regardless of sleep quality, stress, or soreness.

Right: Use readiness scores to auto-regulate daily intensity. The program is a plan, not a contract. Adjust based on the body's signals.

### 3. Skipping Deloads

Wrong: Train at maximum intensity for 12+ weeks without a planned recovery week.

Right: Schedule deload weeks every 4-8 weeks depending on training experience. Fitness is built during recovery, not during the workout.

### 4. Cardio as Punishment

Wrong: Add extra cardio sessions as punishment for dietary lapses or to "earn" food.

Right: Program cardio for cardiovascular health, endurance, and recovery. Separate exercise from food morality entirely.

### 5. Neglecting Movement Quality

Wrong: Add weight to the bar when the current load produces compensatory movement patterns.

Right: Film key lifts periodically. Only progress load when form is consistent across all working sets. Technique is a long-term investment in injury-free training.
