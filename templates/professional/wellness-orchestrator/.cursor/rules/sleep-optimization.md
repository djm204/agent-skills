# Sleep Optimization

Guidelines for sleep architecture analysis, circadian rhythm management, sleep hygiene protocols, and integration of sleep quality into the broader wellness plan.

## Sleep Principles

- **Consistency is king** - A consistent wake time (same time every day, including weekends) is the single most impactful sleep habit; it anchors the circadian clock
- **Quality over quantity** - Eight hours in bed with 70% efficiency is worse than seven hours with 90% efficiency; optimize sleep efficiency before extending duration
- **Sleep is a skill, not a switch** - Good sleep requires a learned wind-down routine, environmental control, and daytime habits that support the circadian rhythm
- **Every domain affects sleep** - Training timing, caffeine intake, caloric balance, stress, and screen habits all modulate sleep architecture; never troubleshoot sleep in isolation
- **Respect individual chronotype** - Some people are naturally early risers, others are night owls; work with chronotype where possible rather than forcing an unnatural schedule

## Sleep Architecture Targets

| Stage | Target % | Primary Function | Optimization Lever |
|-------|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Deep Sleep (N3) | 15-25% | Physical recovery, growth hormone, immune repair | Regular exercise, consistent schedule, cool room |
| REM Sleep | 20-25% | Memory consolidation, emotional processing | Avoid alcohol, manage stress, adequate total sleep |
| Light Sleep (N1+N2) | 50-60% | Transition, memory processing, body maintenance | Natural proportion when deep and REM are optimized |
| Awake | Less than 5% | Normal micro-arousals | Address noise, temperature, pain, anxiety |

## Sleep Quality Metrics

| Metric | Good | Acceptable | Needs Attention |
|--------|------|------------|-----------------|
| Total sleep time | 7-9 hours | 6-7 hours | Below 6 hours |
| Sleep efficiency | Above 90% | 85-90% | Below 85% |
| Sleep onset latency | Under 15 min | 15-30 min | Over 30 min |
| Wake after sleep onset | Under 20 min | 20-40 min | Over 40 min |
| Night awakenings | 0-1 | 2-3 | 4+ or prolonged |
| Resting heart rate trend | At or below baseline | Slightly elevated | Elevated 5+ bpm for 3+ days |
| HRV trend | At or above baseline | Slightly below baseline | Below baseline for 5+ days |

## Sleep Hygiene Protocol

```text
Sleep Environment Checklist
├── Temperature: 65-68F / 18-20C (cool room supports core temp drop)
├── Light: Blackout curtains or sleep mask (any light suppresses melatonin)
├── Sound: Earplugs or white noise machine (consistency matters more than silence)
├── Mattress and pillow: Supportive and comfortable (replace per manufacturer timeline)
├── Electronics: Phones and tablets outside arm's reach or in another room
└── Air quality: Ventilated room; consider air purifier if allergies present
```

## Circadian Rhythm Management

| Time Relative to Wake | Action | Mechanism |
|----------------------|--------|-----------|
| Within 30 min of waking | 10-20 min bright light exposure (sunlight preferred) | Suppresses melatonin, advances circadian clock |
| Morning | Highest-intensity exercise (if schedule allows) | Rising core temperature supports alertness and performance |
| Early afternoon | Nap if needed, 20-30 min maximum, before 2:00 PM | Aligns with natural post-lunch circadian dip |
| 8-10 hours before bed | Caffeine cutoff | Half-life of caffeine is 5-6 hours; quarter-life is 10-12 hours |
| 3-4 hours before bed | Complete vigorous exercise | Allows core temperature to drop for sleep onset |
| 2-3 hours before bed | Dim lights, switch to warm-spectrum | Signals melatonin production onset |
| 1 hour before bed | No screens or use blue-light filter, begin wind-down routine | Prevents melatonin suppression, activates relaxation |
| Bedtime | Cool, dark, quiet environment | Supports thermoregulation cascade for sleep onset |

## Wind-Down Routine Design

A consistent 30-60 minute pre-bed routine signals the brain to prepare for sleep:

| Phase | Duration | Activities |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Transition (optional) | 10-15 min | Light household tasks, preparing for tomorrow, setting out clothes |
| Relaxation | 15-30 min | Reading (physical book), gentle stretching, journaling, breathwork |
| Final preparation | 5-10 min | Brush teeth, skincare, set alarm, place phone away from bed |
| In bed | 5-10 min | Body scan meditation, 4-7-8 breathing, or progressive muscle relaxation |

## Sleep Disruptors and Countermeasures

| Disruptor | Impact on Sleep | Countermeasure |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Caffeine after cutoff | Increases sleep onset latency, reduces deep sleep | Enforce 8-10 hour pre-bed cutoff; switch to decaf or herbal tea |
| Alcohol (any amount) | Suppresses REM, fragments second half of night | Limit to 1-2 drinks; stop 3+ hours before bed; hydrate |
| Late intense exercise | Elevates core temperature and cortisol | Complete vigorous training 3-4 hours before bed |
| Large late meals | Digestive activity disrupts sleep onset | Finish last large meal 2-3 hours before bed |
| Blue light exposure | Suppresses melatonin production | Use blue-light filter after sunset; switch to warm lighting |
| Stress and rumination | Activates sympathetic nervous system, delays onset | Evening journaling, worry time earlier in day, breathwork |
| Irregular schedule | Desynchronizes circadian clock | Anchor wake time within 30-min window, even weekends |
| Napping too late or too long | Reduces sleep pressure for nighttime | Cap naps at 20-30 min; complete before 2:00 PM |

## When to Recommend Professional Evaluation

| Signal | Duration | Recommended Action |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Snoring with gasping or witnessed apneas | Any frequency | Refer for sleep study (rule out obstructive sleep apnea) |
| Excessive daytime sleepiness despite 7+ hours | 2+ weeks | Refer for sleep study |
| Inability to fall asleep within 45 min consistently | 3+ weeks | Refer for CBT-I (cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia) |
| Restless legs or periodic limb movements | Nightly or near-nightly | Refer to sleep medicine specialist |
| Sleep efficiency below 75% despite hygiene optimization | 4+ weeks | Refer for clinical evaluation |
| Reliance on sleep medication for any sleep | Ongoing | Recommend physician review for taper plan and CBT-I |

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Extending Time in Bed Without Improving Efficiency

Wrong: Spend 9-10 hours in bed hoping that more time will yield more sleep, while actually lying awake for 2+ hours.

Right: Calculate sleep efficiency (time asleep / time in bed). If below 85%, restrict time in bed to actual sleep time plus 15 minutes. This builds sleep pressure and improves efficiency. Extend gradually as efficiency improves.

### 2. Weekend Sleep Schedule Shifts

Wrong: Wake at 6:00 AM on weekdays and 10:00 AM on weekends, creating "social jet lag."

Right: Keep wake time within a 30-minute window every day. If sleep debt accumulates during the week, recover with an earlier bedtime rather than a later wake time.

### 3. Using Alcohol as a Sleep Aid

Wrong: Rely on a glass of wine to "relax" before bed.

Right: Alcohol may reduce sleep onset latency but reliably fragments the second half of the night and suppresses REM sleep. Net effect is worse sleep quality, even if it feels easier to fall asleep.

### 4. Ignoring Sleep When Adjusting Other Domains

Wrong: Increase training volume or decrease calories without monitoring sleep impact.

Right: Sleep is the first metric to check when any other wellness domain changes. Training and nutrition modifications that degrade sleep are counterproductive.

### 5. Obsessing Over Wearable Sleep Scores

Wrong: Lose sleep worrying about a low sleep score (orthosomnia).

Right: Use wearable sleep data for trend detection over weeks, not nightly judgment. If sleep tracking causes anxiety, remove the daily score notification and review weekly averages only.
