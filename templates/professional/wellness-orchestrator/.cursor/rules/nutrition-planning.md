# Nutrition Planning

Guidelines for caloric targeting, macronutrient distribution, micronutrient awareness, meal timing, and sustainable dietary pattern design within a whole-person wellness framework.

## Nutrition Principles

- **Calories determine weight direction** - No macronutrient ratio, meal timing, or food choice overrides the fundamental energy balance equation
- **Protein is the priority macronutrient** - Adequate protein (1.4-2.4 g/kg bodyweight depending on goal) supports muscle retention, satiety, and recovery regardless of the overall dietary pattern
- **Sustainability over perfection** - A nutrition approach that someone will follow consistently at 80% adherence outperforms an optimal plan followed at 40%
- **Food quality matters beyond macros** - Whole, minimally processed foods provide fiber, micronutrients, and phytochemicals that supplements and processed alternatives cannot fully replicate
- **No morality in food choices** - Frame dietary decisions in terms of alignment with goals and preferences, never as "good" or "bad" eating

## Caloric Target Setting

| Step | Method | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Estimate BMR | Mifflin-St Jeor equation | Most validated for general population |
| Apply activity multiplier | TDEE = BMR x activity factor (1.2 to 1.9) | Be conservative; most people overestimate activity level |
| Set goal adjustment | Fat loss: -300 to -500 kcal; Gain: +200 to +400 kcal | Never exceed -500 kcal deficit without medical supervision |
| Monitor and adapt | Compare 7-day weight average every 2 weeks | Adjust by 100-200 kcal increments only |
| Plan diet breaks | 1-2 weeks at maintenance every 8-12 weeks of deficit | Reduces metabolic adaptation and psychological fatigue |

## Macronutrient Guidelines by Goal

| Goal | Protein (g/kg) | Carbohydrate | Fat | Key Rationale |
|------|---------------|-------------|-----|---------------|
| Fat loss | 1.8-2.4 | 30-40% remaining kcal | 25-35% remaining kcal | High protein for satiety and muscle preservation |
| Maintenance | 1.4-2.0 | 40-55% remaining kcal | 25-35% remaining kcal | Balanced for long-term sustainability |
| Muscle gain | 1.6-2.2 | 45-60% remaining kcal | 20-30% remaining kcal | Carbs fuel training and support anabolism |
| Endurance sport | 1.4-1.8 | 50-65% remaining kcal | 20-30% remaining kcal | High carb for glycogen replenishment |
| General health | 1.2-1.6 | 40-55% remaining kcal | 25-35% remaining kcal | Emphasize food quality and diversity over ratios |

## Meal Timing Framework

| Window | Guideline | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Pre-workout (1-3 hours) | Moderate carbs (0.5-1 g/kg), moderate protein (20-30g), low fat and fiber | Fuel performance without GI distress |
| Post-workout (within 2 hours) | Protein (20-40g), carbs (0.5-1.5 g/kg) | Support muscle protein synthesis and glycogen repletion |
| Pre-sleep | Casein protein or cottage cheese (30g protein); avoid large meals within 2 hours of bed | Overnight amino acid supply without sleep disruption |
| General distribution | Spread protein across 3-5 meals (20-40g per meal) | Maximizes daily muscle protein synthesis response |
| Caffeine cutoff | 8-10 hours before bedtime | Protects sleep quality (half-life of caffeine is 5-6 hours) |

## Micronutrient and Supplement Priorities

| Priority Tier | Nutrient | When to Consider | Source Preference |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Tier 1 (common gaps) | Vitamin D | Indoor lifestyle, northern latitude, dark skin | Sunlight first, then D3 supplement (1000-4000 IU) |
| Tier 1 | Omega-3 (EPA+DHA) | Low fish intake (< 2 servings/week) | Fatty fish first, then fish or algae oil (1-3g) |
| Tier 1 | Magnesium | High stress, heavy training, poor sleep | Dark greens and nuts first, then glycinate or threonate supplement |
| Tier 2 (conditional) | Creatine monohydrate | Strength and power goals | 3-5g daily, no loading needed |
| Tier 2 | Iron | Menstruation, plant-based diet, endurance athletes | Food sources first; supplement only with confirmed deficiency |
| Tier 2 | B12 | Vegan or vegetarian diet | Fortified foods or supplement (250-1000 mcg) |
| Tier 3 (situational) | Protein powder | When whole food protein targets are difficult to meet | Whey, casein, or plant blend as needed |
| Tier 3 | Electrolytes | Heavy sweating, prolonged exercise, low-carb diets | Sodium, potassium, magnesium in water during activity |

## Dietary Pattern Assessment

When evaluating or recommending a dietary approach:

| Factor | Question to Ask |
|--------|----------------|
| Adherence history | What dietary patterns has this person sustained for 6+ months before? |
| Preference alignment | Does this pattern include foods the person actually enjoys eating? |
| Social compatibility | Can this pattern accommodate social meals, travel, and cultural foods? |
| Nutritional completeness | Does this pattern provide all essential nutrients without excessive supplementation? |
| Goal alignment | Does the macro and caloric structure support the person's stated goals? |
| Psychological safety | Is there any history of disordered eating that a restrictive pattern could trigger? |

## Hydration Guidelines

| Context | Target | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Baseline daily intake | 30-40 ml per kg bodyweight | Adjust upward for heat, altitude, and high-fiber diets |
| During exercise (< 60 min) | Water as needed by thirst | Thirst is adequate for moderate-duration activity |
| During exercise (> 60 min) | 500-1000 ml/hour with electrolytes | Match sweat rate; sodium is the priority electrolyte |
| Post-exercise rehydration | 1.5x fluid lost (weigh before and after) | Include sodium to improve fluid retention |
| Alcohol offset | 1 glass water per alcoholic drink | Alcohol is a diuretic; pre-hydrate before social events |

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Extreme Deficits for Fast Results

Wrong: Set a 1000+ kcal deficit to lose weight as fast as possible.

Right: Moderate deficits (300-500 kcal) preserve muscle, support training performance, and reduce the rebound risk. Faster is not better when it leads to muscle loss and metabolic adaptation.

### 2. Tracking Without Understanding

Wrong: Hit macro targets using exclusively processed foods and supplements while ignoring food quality.

Right: Use macro tracking as a guide, not a game. Prioritize whole foods for 80% of intake and use tracking to identify patterns, not to justify poor food choices that technically "fit the macros."

### 3. Eliminating Entire Food Groups Without Cause

Wrong: Remove all dairy, gluten, or carbohydrates based on general wellness trends without a diagnosed intolerance or allergy.

Right: Eliminate a food group only when there is a confirmed medical reason (allergy, celiac, lactose intolerance) or when a structured elimination protocol reveals a clear symptom connection.

### 4. Ignoring the Diet-Sleep-Mood Connection

Wrong: Maintain a steep caloric deficit while wondering why sleep quality has declined and irritability has increased.

Right: Use the cross-domain interaction map. Nutrition changes affect sleep, mood, and training performance. Monitor all domains when making dietary adjustments and ease the deficit if mood or sleep deteriorate significantly.

### 5. Supplement Before Food

Wrong: Spend heavily on supplements while eating a nutrient-poor diet.

Right: Supplements fill gaps; they do not replace a foundation of whole foods. Address food quality and diversity first. Supplement only confirmed deficiencies or well-supported ergogenic aids.
