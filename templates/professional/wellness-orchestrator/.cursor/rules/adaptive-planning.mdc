# Adaptive Planning

Guidelines for cross-domain optimization, goal balancing, progress tracking, plan adjustment triggers, and maintaining a unified wellness plan that responds to changing conditions.

## Adaptive Planning Principles

- **Plans are hypotheses, not contracts** - Every wellness plan is a best guess based on current data; it must be updated as the person's body, life, and goals change
- **Adjust one variable at a time** - When a plan needs modification, change one domain or one parameter at a time and observe for 1-2 weeks before making additional changes
- **Lead indicators over lag indicators** - Readiness scores, mood trends, and adherence rates predict future outcomes; body weight and performance numbers confirm past outcomes
- **Sustainability beats optimization** - A plan that someone follows consistently for 6 months outperforms an aggressive plan abandoned after 3 weeks
- **Regression is information, not failure** - When metrics decline, investigate the cause rather than pushing harder; the decline is a signal, not a character flaw

## Cross-Domain Interaction Reference

| Domain A | Domain B | Key Interaction | Management Strategy |
|----------|----------|----------------|---------------------|
| Fitness | Nutrition | Training volume drives caloric need; deficit impairs recovery | Align caloric target with training phase; increase intake during high-volume blocks |
| Fitness | Sleep | Intense late-evening exercise disrupts sleep onset | Complete vigorous training 3-4 hours before bed; use readiness scores to auto-regulate |
| Fitness | Mental Wellness | Exercise is a potent mood booster; overtraining causes mood decline | Monitor mood alongside training load; deload when both decline together |
| Nutrition | Sleep | Large meals and caffeine disrupt sleep; alcohol suppresses REM | Enforce caffeine cutoff; finish large meals 2-3 hours before bed |
| Nutrition | Mental Wellness | Severe deficit increases irritability; gut health affects mood | Monitor mood when changing diet; ease deficit if mood drops below 4/10 for 3+ days |
| Sleep | Mental Wellness | Sleep deprivation amplifies emotional reactivity; anxiety drives insomnia | Prioritize sleep when stress is high; use CBT-I techniques for anxiety-related insomnia |

## Plan Adjustment Trigger Matrix

| Trigger | Detection Method | Threshold | Response Protocol |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Weight plateau | 7-day rolling average | No change for 3+ weeks | Reassess calories, check adherence, consider diet break |
| Readiness decline | Composite readiness score | Below 50 for 3+ consecutive days | Reduce training volume, extend sleep target, audit stressors |
| Mood decline | Self-reported mood scale | Below 4/10 for 3+ consecutive days | Prioritize mental wellness protocols, reduce training intensity |
| Sleep quality drop | Efficiency or duration trend | Efficiency below 80% for 1+ week | Full sleep hygiene audit, check caffeine and alcohol, assess anxiety |
| Persistent soreness | Self-reported soreness map | Above 6/10 in any muscle group for 72+ hours | Deload that muscle group, add recovery modalities, rule out injury |
| Motivation decline | Self-reported engagement | Drop of 2+ points sustained over 1 week | Introduce variety, reassess goal relevance, consider social training |
| Life disruption | Self-reported event | Travel, illness, family crisis, job change | Switch to maintenance plan across all domains until stability returns |
| Lab values out of range | Clinical blood work | Any clinically significant result | Consult physician before adjusting wellness plan |

## Goal Balancing Framework

When goals compete across domains, use this priority hierarchy:

```text
Goal Priority Hierarchy (default ordering)
├── Tier 1: Health Protection
│   ├── Adequate sleep (7+ hours, 85%+ efficiency)
│   ├── No active injury or illness progression
│   ├── Mental wellness above critical thresholds
│   └── Clinical markers within normal ranges
├── Tier 2: Recovery Capacity
│   ├── Readiness scores averaging above 60
│   ├── Stress load manageable (below 7/10 sustained)
│   └── Social connection maintained
├── Tier 3: Active Goals
│   ├── Body composition targets (fat loss, muscle gain)
│   ├── Performance targets (strength, endurance, sport)
│   └── Habit formation targets (meditation streak, nutrition adherence)
└── Tier 4: Optimization
    ├── Fine-tuning macro ratios
    ├── Supplement protocols
    └── Advanced periodization details
```

A Tier 3 goal must never compromise a Tier 1 or Tier 2 item. If a fat loss deficit is degrading sleep and mood (Tier 1), ease the deficit regardless of body composition progress.

## Weekly Review Protocol

Every wellness plan should include a structured weekly review covering:

| Review Area | Key Questions |
|-------------|---------------|
| Training | Sessions completed vs. planned? Volume and intensity appropriate per readiness? Any pain or form concerns? |
| Nutrition | Calorie and protein targets hit what percentage of days? Food quality maintained? Hydration adequate? |
| Sleep | Average duration and efficiency on track? Consistent schedule maintained? Any new disruptors? |
| Mental wellness | Mood and stress trends stable or improving? Mindfulness practice maintained? Social connection adequate? |
| Cross-domain | Any domain declining as another improves? Any trigger thresholds approached or crossed? |
| Adjustments | What one change (if any) should be made for next week? |

## Adherence Tracking

| Adherence Level | Percentage | Interpretation | Action |
|----------------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Excellent | 90-100% | Sustainable and on track | Maintain current plan |
| Good | 75-89% | Effective progress with normal life variability | Maintain; minor tweaks only |
| Fair | 60-74% | Progress possible but plan may be too demanding | Simplify plan, reduce number of tracked variables |
| Poor | Below 60% | Plan is not matching the person's reality | Major reassessment: is the plan realistic given schedule, preferences, and life demands? |

Adherence below 60% for two consecutive weeks is a plan design problem, not a willpower problem. Redesign the plan to fit the person's actual life.

## Phase Transitions

When transitioning between wellness phases (e.g., fat loss to maintenance, or off-season to competition prep):

| Transition | Duration | Key Actions |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Deficit to maintenance | 2-4 weeks (reverse diet) | Increase calories by 100-200 kcal per week; maintain training volume; monitor weight stabilization |
| Maintenance to surplus | 1-2 weeks | Increase calories by 200-300 kcal; add training volume gradually; monitor body composition trends |
| High-volume to deload | 1 week | Reduce volume 40-60%, intensity 20-30%; prioritize sleep and nutrition quality |
| Structured training to active recovery | 1-2 weeks | Remove structured programming; emphasize play, recreation, and movement variety |
| Injury/illness to return-to-training | 2-6 weeks (varies) | Start at 50% of pre-injury volume; progress 10-20% per week; monitor pain and readiness |

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Changing Too Many Variables at Once

Wrong: Simultaneously increase training volume, decrease calories, and add a new morning meditation habit.

Right: Change one variable at a time and observe for 1-2 weeks. If the person's weight stalls, change calories or training, not both. Isolating variables makes it possible to identify what works and what does not.

### 2. Ignoring Adherence Data

Wrong: Keep prescribing a plan that the person follows less than 60% of the time and blame lack of discipline.

Right: Low adherence is feedback about the plan, not the person. Simplify, reduce the number of targets, align with preferences, and build from what is actually sustainable.

### 3. Refusing to Back Off

Wrong: Maintain aggressive goals when readiness, mood, and sleep are all declining.

Right: Use the goal priority hierarchy. If Tier 1 (health protection) items are compromised, pull back on Tier 3 (active goals) immediately. Short-term setbacks in body composition or performance are preferable to burnout, injury, or mental health crises.

### 4. Review Without Action

Wrong: Complete the weekly review template, note that sleep has declined for two weeks, and do nothing about it.

Right: Every review must produce a specific adjustment or an explicit decision to hold course. If no action is taken after identifying a declining trend, the review process is theater.

### 5. Treating the Plan as Permanent

Wrong: Create a 12-week plan and follow it rigidly regardless of how the person responds.

Right: Plans are living documents. Review weekly, adjust as needed, and perform a major reassessment at the end of each mesocycle or phase. The best plan for week 1 is rarely the best plan for week 8.
