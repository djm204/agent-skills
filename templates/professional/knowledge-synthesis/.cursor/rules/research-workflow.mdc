# Research Workflow

Rules for integrating knowledge synthesis into the daily and weekly research process.

## Research Phases

Each phase maps to specific knowledge actions:

| Phase | Knowledge Action | System Feature |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| Question Formation | Search for prior thinking on the topic | Semantic search, graph browse |
| Literature Review | Ingest and classify new sources | Ingestion pipeline |
| Reading | Create literature notes, apply progressive summarization | Note creation, highlighting |
| Analysis | Create permanent notes, link to graph | Zettelkasten, graph construction |
| Synthesis | Build topic summaries, concept maps | Summarization hierarchy |
| Writing | Retrieve and cite from knowledge base | Citation manager, search |
| Revision | Update notes with new understanding | Version tracking |
| Publication | Export bibliography, archive project notes | Export, archival |

## Daily Routine (30-45 minutes)

### Morning (15 minutes)
- Process fleeting notes inbox: convert to literature/permanent notes or discard
- Review 3-5 random permanent notes via spaced repetition
- Check for new documents awaiting ingestion

### During Work
- Capture fleeting notes as ideas occur (do not interrupt deep work to process them)
- Create literature notes while actively reading
- Link new notes to existing knowledge immediately

### Evening (15 minutes)
- Process remaining fleeting notes
- Update structure notes if topic clusters shifted
- Log one "idea of the day" for future review

## Weekly Review (60-90 minutes)

### Inbox Zero
- All fleeting notes processed or discarded
- All new documents classified and metadata complete
- All highlights converted to literature notes

### Graph Maintenance
- Review orphan notes and link or archive them
- Merge duplicate concept nodes
- Update structure notes and maps of content

### Summarization
- Write or update one topic summary
- Promote mature literature notes to permanent status

### Reflection
- What surprised me this week?
- What contradicted my prior understanding?
- What question do I want to explore next week?

## Note Processing Rules

### Fleeting Notes
- Must be processed within 48 hours or explicitly archived
- Never link fleeting notes to the knowledge graph directly
- A fleeting note becomes either a literature note, a permanent note, or trash

### Literature Notes
- One note per key idea (not one note per source)
- Written in your own words, never copy-paste
- Always linked to the bibliographic record
- Tagged with source, topic, and date

### Permanent Notes
- Atomic: exactly one idea
- Self-contained: understandable without reading the source
- Connected: at least one link to another permanent note
- Versioned: includes creation date and update log

## Integration Points

| External Tool | Sync Method | Direction |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| Reference Manager (Zotero) | BibTeX / CSL-JSON | Bidirectional |
| PDF Reader | Annotation export | Into system |
| Note App (Obsidian, Logseq) | Markdown + backlinks | Bidirectional |
| Search Index | Update on change | From system |
| Vector Database | Embed on create/update | From system |
| Writing Tool | Citation insertion | From system |
| Web Browser | Clip extension | Into system |

## Version Tracking

When understanding of an idea changes:

1. Create a new version of the note (do not overwrite)
2. Add a change log entry: date, what changed, what triggered the change
3. Link the new version to the previous version
4. Update all incoming links to point to the latest version
5. Mark the old version as superseded (never delete)

## Project Lifecycle

When starting a research project:

1. Search existing notes for prior thinking
2. Create a project structure note linking all relevant permanent notes
3. Identify gaps in current knowledge
4. Build a targeted reading list to fill gaps
5. Track project-specific notes separately (they are temporary)

When completing a project:

1. Promote any project notes worth keeping to permanent status
2. Archive remaining project notes
3. Update topic summaries affected by the project
4. Export bibliography for the final output
5. Write a brief retrospective: what did this project teach me?
