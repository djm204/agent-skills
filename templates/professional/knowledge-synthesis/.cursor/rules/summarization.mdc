# Summarization

Rules for creating, layering, and maintaining summaries across the knowledge base.

## Summarization Pyramid

Summaries exist at five levels. Each level compresses the one below it:

| Level | Name | Scope | Target Length |
|-------|------|-------|---------------|
| 0 | Raw Source | Full original text | Unmodified |
| 1 | Extracted Notes | Key passages and quotes per source | 10-20% of original |
| 2 | Atomic Summaries | One-paragraph summary per concept | 50-150 words |
| 3 | Topic Summaries | Multi-source synthesis per topic | 1-2 pages |
| 4 | Domain Overviews | Comprehensive survey of a research area | 5-10 pages |
| 5 | Executive Brief | Cross-domain strategic summary | 1 page max |

## Progressive Summarization Process

Apply layers sequentially. Do not skip levels.

1. **Layer 0 - Capture**: Save the full source. No modification.
2. **Layer 1 - Bold**: Mark the most important passages (10-20% of text).
3. **Layer 2 - Highlight**: Within bolded passages, highlight the core insight (2-5%).
4. **Layer 3 - Summary**: Write a 2-3 sentence summary in your own words.
5. **Layer 4 - Remix**: Combine with other notes into original output.

Not every source needs all layers. Apply deeper layers only when you return to a source repeatedly.

## Quality Criteria

Every summary must satisfy:

- [ ] **Accurate** - No factual errors. Verify against source.
- [ ] **Complete** - All key claims from the source are represented.
- [ ] **Concise** - Within target word count. No redundancy.
- [ ] **Attributed** - Every claim traceable to a specific source and location.
- [ ] **Neutral** - No opinion injected unless explicitly labeled as commentary.
- [ ] **Coherent** - Reads logically from start to finish.

## Topic Summary Template

```
## Topic Summary: [Name]

Last Updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]
Sources Synthesized: [count]
Confidence: [High / Medium / Low]

### Definition
[2-3 sentences defining the topic]

### Key Claims
1. [Claim] - supported by [sources]
2. [Claim] - challenged by [sources]

### Open Questions
- [Unresolved question]

### Related Topics
- [[Topic A]] - [relationship]

### Change Log
| Date | Change | Trigger |
|------|--------|---------|
```

## When to Summarize

- **On ingestion**: Create Level 1 (extracted notes) for every new source
- **On second encounter**: Promote to Level 2 (atomic summary)
- **On third encounter or deliberate review**: Create Level 3 (topic summary)
- **On project kickoff**: Build Level 4 (domain overview) for the project's domain
- **On request**: Generate Level 5 (executive brief) for stakeholder communication

## Maintenance Rules

- Update topic summaries when any underlying source is added or revised
- Mark summaries with a "stale" flag if underlying notes changed and summary has not
- Re-verify accuracy of summaries older than 6 months
- Never delete a summary; supersede it and link to the replacement
- Track summary freshness: `last_updated` vs `latest_source_change`

## Summarization Anti-Patterns

- Summarizing without reading the full source first
- Using the source's exact words instead of paraphrasing
- Creating a summary that cannot stand alone without the source
- Omitting contradictory evidence to make the summary cleaner
- Failing to update summaries when new evidence arrives
